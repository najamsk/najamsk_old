  <div class="entry-content"><p>When your web application is running on web server and you don&#8217;t have automatic backup service available form your hosting service provider taking manual backups is really a frustrating job.</p>

<p>I have <a href="https://pscx.codeplex.com/">Pscx</a> module installed on my PC and they have a nice little command Write-Zip available so I decided to write a custom powershell function that can create archive in zip formats for me. You can use windows task scheduler to invoke any powershell script so you can take advantage of this to have automatic daily or monthly backups.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am managing different servers and each of them have different responsibilities.</p>

<p>I am learning powershell and trying to build lego blocks that will eventually become recipes for automating tasks on different servers. One important block is email report for that if you don&#8217;t have smtp configured on server you can use following powershell script with gmail SMTP information.</p>

<p>I will open source on <a href="https://github.com/najamsk/powershellRepo">github</a> many of the small powershell scripts that you can make use of to build somethign cool.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Following is the email I  have sent to ebill@ptcl.net.pk it&#8217;s unplugged raw version so don&#8217;t mind about mistakes.</p>

<p>Since i have shifted to new house date you can check in your records that corresponds with address change I am facing dsl connection issues with line disturbance</p>

<p>I have tried all mediums to get some help for permanent solution but no luck that involves talking to agents, exchange staff, email to billing team and ptcl twitter account. Every time when situation reach to worst point where I could take no more they promise me some fix that can only work for 5 days at its best.</p>

<p>I have no of issues
 * charged for address change moths ago but not getting printed bill. Mention this to call center agent promised this will be fix but as you ptcl more then me you can guess the result.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Line is noisy and cause of data loss even when its no noise or less simple ping command can show you that. But the staff &#8220;Technical&#8221; staff mostly visit me don&#8217;t know about ping they just open a website and say see website work tor this vary instant its working we cant do anything else. Lineman also king of UAE I guess even ptcl staff don&#8217;t have power to call him when they require him. I am not joking one of ptcl dsl department guy told me once &#8220;sir mai call kar kar kai thak gia hoon usi kai liyeah app kai ghar kai bhair khara hoon aub app khud he lineman kai liyeah ptcl mai kisi ko bolyeah mai kuch nahi kar sakta&#8221;</p></li>
<li><p>Dsl stablity: speed is slow most of the time. Now a days if phone rings net disconnect, if someone pick receiver net disconnect, if you are talking on phone net disconnect.</p></li>
<li><p>Call center: every time same questions, same promises but no result. Yestday 24 jan 201 I talked to your agent between 9:00pm to 10:00pm. it was long a call and i wanted him to terminate my services but he said 24 hours time required and I am personally involved with your complaint. Today in morning when I get up from bed I check sms from ptcl saying my complaint no  93 has been closed yesterday around 10:00pm.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Filled with anger called your call center female agent again asking me whats the issue like there is no complaint history in front of her i ask for manage but that manager is not for common people of pakistan so after her  promises that were not new she said talk to supervisor which I refused and asked her to transfer my call to billing department.</p>

<p>I do believe same person picked my call as billing representative and when i told her remove my dsl and phone line from billing she start doing same promises. When i explain the whole history to her then she said all the time I am facing issue with line or dsl that can be adjusted in billing. Imagine my surprise with my complaint history in which i have faced dead phone line for 15 days and  I was never told of this thing by any call center agent. So this is one new problem I discover called &#8220;Theft&#8221;. Anyways she said before this day ends my problem will be fixed she will be taking this matter with her seniors, army cheif and prime minister of pakistan and i will not face this kind of issue again.</p>

<p>So based on above if you read all i wrote above after wasting 30 more minutes of life with PTCL tag on it kindly remove me from billing (land-line and dsl) if my issue is not fixed by day end.</p>

<p>I will pay the latest bill i have already printed and after that would not pay anything in case you are still keeping me in your billing records.</p>

<p>Best,</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am very much into learning new tools and burning hours of my life trying to figure them out. To track whats new on development horizon and technology I tend to keep my eyes on sessions, conferences, blogs and screen-casts.</p>

<p>In past few days I wanted to explore no-sql options two in particular RavenDB and MongoDB. I have successfully completed the environment setup for raven but didn&#8217;t use it in any project until now. On the other hand I have built a new website for my current employer using MVC4 and MongoDB. I have learned a a lot and in this blog post I will share few commands to setup mongoDB and deploy it on remote server.</p>

<p>You can download MongoDb zip file from http://www.mongodb.org/downloads. I picked 64bit version of it.</p>

<h2>Installing MongoDb as windows service</h2>

<p>To install MongoDB using your command prompt navigate to the bin folder in my case it was on following path:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>D:\mongodb\bin></span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then run following command to install it</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>D:\mongodb\bin>mongod --dbpath=D:\mongodb --logpath=D:\mongodb\log.txt --install</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then you can goto windows services and look for MongoDB service and simply start it. If you face any error during installation make sure you launch command prompt as administrator and log.txt file used in above command do exists in your hard drive.</p>

<p>If for some reason you want to un-install the MongoDB service run following command in command prompt after stopping service from system services.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>D:\mongodb\bin>mongod --remove</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>GUI to manage MongoDB</h2>

<p>You can interact with MongoDb database and collections using command prompt it will make you master of the little quires against small frequent tasks. In my case I wanted some simple GUI to perform simple tasks and I came across <a href="http://robomongo.org/">RoboMongo</a>.</p>

<p>Installation is simple once this tool is installed and you have your MongoDb service up and running. click on the create button showing in following screen.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-W5SYuoYBfqE/UmZNepJZPkI/AAAAAAAACcQ/LVaMJiW2k50/w668-h410-no/roboCreate.jpg" alt="Robo Mongo Connection Screen" /></p>

<p>Proceed with defaults in address I have localhost and using port 27017. After connection is created you can click on the connect button and it will show you following screen listing with your databases and collections.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/fJjuZWRgwzWSRNwF0HzVw4bJ8JryEKLuAwWWIaKlfEY=w1183-h737-no" alt="Robo Mongo Showing Databases and Collections" /></p>

<h2>Deployment</h2>

<p>After completing v1.0 I have been asked to deploy our new web site on remote server. Asp.net deployment was not a big deal but to deploy local MongoDb database onto remote I had to read about two commands <em>mongodump</em> and <em>mongorestore</em></p>

<p>First to create a backup file of my local mongoDB database I run following command</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>mongodump --db DBName</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Above command will generate called DBName under MongoDB_Installation_Folder/bin/dump inside generated folder you will find <em>.bson</em> files for all the collections your database contains. I have uploaded this folder on remote server.</p>

<p>Now to restore MongoDB on remote server I used mongorestore command syntax is simple you need to supply foldername/dbname to restore</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>mongorestore dump/DBName</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Once restore is completed successfully you can check your database on remote using RoboMongo.</p>

<p>I hope this will help someone starting with MongoDB thank you for reading my blog.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I needed to genrate an email log that contains every email from our clients these normally stored in their seprate folder. One way was to copy and paste email headers and body into a word document. Second was to use powershell and got all the emails using some script.</p>

<p>After playing a little with powershell and google few of its basic I have completed my task with powershell.</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/5944505.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>Above code is used to select a folder under your outlook inbox in my case its jun 2013 which comes under EmailLog which is under my inbox. I have saved the result of this function into a variable. That would be passed into second function for html creation.</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/5944515.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>This function will take email objects and wrap html mark around them before saving them into a html file.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The term TDD is not new to me I heard it quite often but never took time to go into details until last few days. I have been checking stuff from YUI team and liked their YUI test framework for now ,but in future i might switch to qUint (jquery testing framework) as I am big fan of jQuery and using it daily.</p>

<p>There are different version of YUI like 2.0,3.0 and standalone version of YUI test that has no dependency over YUI framework according to yui theater video.</p>

<p>So for learning purpose I have written few lines of jQuery to set color of a paragraph on mouse hover. I wrote a test using YUI; in the test I simulate mouse hover event and then checking the paragraph css color properties using jquery :).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been invited to [Microsoft Community Meetup] at marriott hotel islamabad on Friday 19th April 2013. It was really nice experience to meet fellow devs, students and MVP.</p>

<p>Session was about windows 8 platform they have shown few apps that are developed in Pakistan and available for global audience. Highlight of the meetup was teams that have participated in Imagine cup and from pakistan. Team with first position showcased their project and I was blown away by their concept, presentation and business skills.</p>

<p>These students are from <a href="http://www.giki.edu.pk/">Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute</a> and their project is called &#8220;EPI-C&#8221; do check it out.</p>
