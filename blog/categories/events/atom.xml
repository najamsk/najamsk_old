    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have been invited to [Microsoft Community Meetup] at marriott hotel islamabad on Friday 19th April 2013. It was really nice experience to meet fellow devs, students and MVP.</p>

<p>Session was about windows 8 platform they have shown few apps that are developed in Pakistan and available for global audience. Highlight of the meetup was teams that have participated in Imagine cup and from pakistan. Team with first position showcased their project and I was blown away by their concept, presentation and business skills.</p>

<p>These students are from <a href="http://www.giki.edu.pk/">Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute</a> and their project is called "EPI-C" do check it out.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Bahria university hosted a job fair session on 19th April 2013 in which they invites companies from local industry. My company also participated in the event.</p>

<p>Myself and few other from our company spend whole day in the event looking for suitable events in .net, mobile development and social media positions.</p>

<p>All day long I have been interviewing and the answers given by students in 6th and final semesters were disappointing.</p>

<p>Common reason for such answers were:</p>

<ul>
<li>teacher didn't teach us good</li>
<li>course is not yet offered</li>
<li>what we have read we don't remember at the moment</li>
<li>we are here for internship in 6 months you will teach us and than we will score good job in some other company. I don't who told them we are here for schooling and companies will be teaching them for 6 months. Why universities are not teaching them?</li>
</ul>


<p>After attending this I have been thinking about giving sessions to students in web development for following reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Introduce them what industry expects form them as fresh devs.</li>
<li>Also motivate them to learn more and don't rely on university.</li>
<li>Do small contributions in open source for learning.</li>
</ul>


<p>In next post I will outlines topics for basic training if you are interested to contribute in this cause let me know. If you want to attend such sessions than you can contact me.</p>

<p>These sessions will be free and you can contribute in exercise files, topics and provide your valuable feedback.</p>
