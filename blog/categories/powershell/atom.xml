    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am managing different servers and each of them have different responsibilities.</p>

<p>I am learning powershell and trying to build lego blocks that will eventually become recipes for automating tasks on different servers. One important block is email report for that if you don't have smtp configured on server you can use following powershell script with gmail SMTP information.</p>

<p>I will open source on <a href="https://github.com/najamsk/powershellRepo">github</a> many of the small powershell scripts that you can make use of to build somethign cool.</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$EmailFrom = "from@mail.com"
</span><span class='line'>$EmailTo = "to@mail.com"
</span><span class='line'>$Subject = "emailing powershell report"
</span><span class='line'>$Body = "this should work on remove server as well. test email"
</span><span class='line'>$SMTPServer = "smtp.gmail.com"
</span><span class='line'>$SMTPClient = New-Object Net.Mail.SmtpClient($SmtpServer, 587)
</span><span class='line'>$SMTPClient.EnableSsl = $true
</span><span class='line'>$SMTPClient.Credentials = New-Object System.Net.NetworkCredential("gmailUser", "gmailPasswor");
</span><span class='line'>$SMTPClient.Send($EmailFrom, $EmailTo, $Subject, $Body)</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Hope this will help someone, feel free to improve this script and than share it with me you can file bugs on github.</p>

<p>Thanks for your time.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I needed to genrate an email log that contains every email from our clients these normally stored in their seprate folder. One way was to copy and paste email headers and body into a word document. Second was to use powershell and got all the emails using some script.</p>

<p>After playing a little with powershell and google few of its basic I have completed my task with powershell.</p>

<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/5944505.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>

<p>Above code is used to select a folder under your outlook inbox in my case its jun 2013 which comes under EmailLog which is under my inbox. I have saved the result of this function into a variable. That would be passed into second function for html creation.</p>

<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/5944515.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>

<p>This function will take email objects and wrap html mark around them before saving them into a html file.</p>
