  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of my personal goals for this year was to start being part of the solution to the dearth of female speakers at tech events. Though I&rsquo;ve talked at a couple of smallish local events over the past few months, this past weekend I got to do it in a big way: I presented a talk on using objects to organize your jQuery code to an audience of around 100 people, more by far than I&rsquo;ve ever spoken to before.</p>




<p>[This post isn&rsquo;t so much about the talk itself as my first experience with talking at a conference. If you&rsquo;re interested in the talk, I encourage you to check out the slides, links, and code at the link above.]</p>




<p>I decided I wanted to try to talk at the jQuery conference after I saw the initial very smart, very male speaker lineup. I submitted my talk based on an article I wrote earlier this year, and by the time it was all said and done, mine was the second most popular topic and I was slated to have 30 minutes in &ldquo;the big room.&rdquo;</p>




<p>There is something sort of out-of-body about that moment when I am standing in front of a roomful of people right before I talk &mdash; I had it when I gave my first Refresh talk, when I taught my first jQuery class, when I spoke at my first BarCamp RDU, and yet again this weekend. For that moment, in my head, I am a complete and utter case, and can&rsquo;t quite fathom that I thought this was a good idea. And then I start talking, and then it is OK. And then when it&rsquo;s over, people clap, and I like that part.</p>




<p>Back when I set out to start speaking more, I decided to take an improv class. For six weeks, we practiced being spontaneously funny, and at the end, we got up on stage in front of a bunch of strangers and tried to do it for real. Knowing what that feels like &mdash; what it feels like to run up the aisle like you&rsquo;re excited when really you&rsquo;re terrified because you&rsquo;ve never done this before and in real life you sit at a desk all day and talk to no one and what were you thinking? &mdash; makes the thought of talking to a bunch of strangers about what you actually know how to do seem like a completely reasonable thing.</p>




<p>My experience this weekend was nothing short of excellent &mdash; people I barely knew rallied around me throughout the weekend to help me improve my presentation (most notably Chris Williams, organizer of JSConf, to whom I owe many thanks for all the images &mdash; especially the Liger). The audience graciously tolerated the part in the middle where I had to leave the podium to (very publicly) blow my nose. People asked great questions, and audience members gently pointed out things I might want to rethink. With the exception of one creepy off-the-wall comment about my &ldquo;fine-boned features,&rdquo; the reaction was overwhelmingly positive.</p>




<p>Reliable sources told me that of 300 attendees, approximately 282 were men. I was the only woman to submit a talk. So this is the part where I encourage other women to do the same. I think women, on the whole (of course there are exceptions), are way more inclined than men to think they aren&rsquo;t good enough speakers, that they don&rsquo;t know a topic well enough to tell it to other people. Two truths: one, the speaking skills of the speakers I&rsquo;ve seen have been all over the map; two, you&rsquo;d be surprised how much you actually know about a topic, especially given the right audience. Go speak at a small event &mdash; a local meetup, a Refresh, even a lunch-and-learn at your office. Get to know the people who do speak at events, and discover that they&rsquo;re people just like you. Go out on a limb and try something that&rsquo;s</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had a need today to indicate that at least one of a set of input fields was required. I was hoping there was a direct way to do this in the <a href="http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/">jQuery validation plugin</a>; while the method isn&#8217;t quite as straightforward as I was wishing for, it&#8217;s still fairly simple.</p>

<p>To start with, I put <code>class="required_group"</code> on each of the elements in the group. Then, I added a custom validation method:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="nx">jQuery</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">validator</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">addMethod</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;required_group&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">val</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">el</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">$module</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">el</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">parents</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;div.panel&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">$module</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">find</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;.required_group:filled&#39;</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">length</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>&#8230; a custom class rule to take advantage of the new method:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="nx">jQuery</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">validator</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">addClassRules</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;required_group&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="s1">&#39;required_group&#39;</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kc">true</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>&#8230; and finally a custom message for the new method:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="nx">jQuery</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">validator</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">messages</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">required_group</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Please fill out at least one of these fields.&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>What I&#8217;d love to see is a way to specify a dependent group without using a custom class rule, but I&#8217;m not sure what this would look like, as all validation rules are either keyed off an element&#8217;s class or the presence of the element&#8217;s name in the rules object. Thoughts? I&#8217;m open to the possibility that there&#8217;s a far better way to solve this &#8211;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Someone wrote me today:</p>

<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">Where I work, design is highly valued with the leader of that group being our Creative Director, back end programmers are also highly valued, but front end &#8230; not so much. Partly I think its that I don&#8217;t toot my horn but I know there are other reasons. At times, my bosses haven&#8217;t even understood what it is that I do. Back end programmers look down on front end assuming that its trivial or something that should be relegated to compilers.

I was wondering if this is a common thing or more so something that is happening at my particular company, and if you have any advice or pointers on this.</blockquote>


<p>I thought my response might be worth sharing:</p>

<p>I do think this attitude is common but not necessarily the rule. In my experience, I&#8217;ve found that by having a proven value proposition, you can gain converts and respect.</p>

<p>Front end developers are in a unique position to improve page performance (perceived and actual) by using best practices such as the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/">YSlow</a> tests. Front end developers are also in a unique position to help develop templating systems and to write thoughtful CSS, both of which help enable the rapid prototyping and rollout of new features. A focus on results and best practices &#8211; demonstrating that you aren&#8217;t just pushing pixels around &#8211; is the key.</p>

<p>Back end developers respect people who think like they do. Be mindful of opportunities for abstraction and reuse. Write <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/stubbornella/object-oriented-css">object-oriented CSS</a> and JavaScript. Craft solutions that are maintainable and documented. Learn and make use of <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gittutorial.html">version control</a> <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn.intro.quickstart.html">systems</a>. Look for opportunities to participate in developer conversations about new features, and understand what the back end developers are up against. They&#8217;ll appreciate all of this.</p>

<p>Take the time to teach and to learn. Be sure you have at least a passing understanding of the code the back end developers are writing, and leap at opportunities to share your knowledge. I&#8217;ve worked with more than one back end developer who was surprised to discover what all they didn&#8217;t know about the front end, and through our conversations about how we approached problems, we both learned a lot.</p>

<p>Finally: identify opportunities for quick victories, execute on them, and make the results known. Benchmark before and after. Can you reduce the number of HTTP requests on a page, decreasing both the perceived and actual rendering time? Are you keeping your JavaScript out of the &lt;head&gt; as much as possible, preventing pages from stalling while rendering? Can you write JavaScript that is primed for reuse, and demonstrate opportunities for that reuse? Has your carefully crafted CSS allowed the rapid rollout of a new feature? Don&#8217;t be afraid to tell these stories &#8211; they&#8217;ll tend to strengthen your position by clarifying the important role the front-end developer plays in a site.</p>

<p>Good luck :)</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s been some backlash lately against CSS, and some of it seems so well reasoned that even I find myself wondering if tables are really so bad after all. From <a href="http://giveupandusetables.com/">giveupandusetables.com</a>, which says the maximum time to spend before abandoning CSS is 47 minutes, to the <a href="http://www.flownet.com/ron/css-rant.html">well-illustrated blog post by Ron Garret</a>, the general argument is that CSS isn&#8217;t up to the task of faithfully reproducing elaborate designs cross-browser in an acceptable amount of developer time.</p>

<p>In his post about Garret&#8217;s article, <a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/css-for-layout-another-rant">Dion Almaer at Ajaxian</a> opines:</p>

<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">CSS purist[s] may poo poo him and say &#8220;he is just dumb and doesn&#8217;t REALLY know CSS.&#8221; The problem though is that most developers run into exactly the pain that he describes. We’ve all been there. It drives you nuts and when frustrated what do you do? You fluster about and change CSS like a mad man until it kinda looks right. And, you never learn what the real problem was, and thus destined to make the same mistake again.</blockquote>


<p>It seems that while developers are thinking about sacrificing web standards for the perceived simplicity of tables, the viability of the design rarely enters the debate, and that&#8217;s a shame. In my experience, some of the most difficult designs to produce using CSS were fundamentally flawed from the get-go, created by designers who failed to grasp that the web is not like print.</p>

<p><strong>The web is not like print.</strong> In print, designers have near-total control over the output, because the number of new &#8220;pages&#8221; &#8211; items of content &#8211; is limited by the cost of printing. If a print designer wants text vertically centered in a fixed-height column, or two columns that are exactly the same height, or rounded corners with drop shadows on top of gradients, there&#8217;s no reason they can&#8217;t have that. The cost of printing is sufficiently high, and print graphics programs are sufficiently sophisticated, that making those design decisions has no impact on the marginal cost of production.</p>

<p>On the web, the marginal cost of creating a new page of content can be approximately zero, but to achieve that we <em>must</em> build pages that adapt to unpredictable content and unpredictable users. If we don&#8217;t, we won&#8217;t realize the economies of scale that the web has to offer. The tradeoff for that infinitesimally small marginal cost is that the rules have to be different, because the cost of implementing those print-centric design decisions is inordinately high. Instead of sophisticated graphics programs, the web has mere humans to turn PSDs into working pages; instead of content created by experts and pored over by editors, the web has volumes of user-generated content, and the ability to change it on a whim.</p>

<p>On the web, equal-height columns will cease to be equal height when the content changes; vertically centered content will outgrow its fixed-height bounds; and rounded corners with drop shadows on gradients can&#8217;t possibly be worth the cost of producing them. These are not problems with CSS that should be solved with tables. They are, fundamentally, problems with the design.</p>

<p>When I talk about this to other developers (and any designers who are willing to give me the time of day after I&#8217;m done pointing out how costly their design will be to produce), I make the analogy that it&#8217;s just as absurd to impose these print-centric design conventions on the web as it would be to use holograms for every picture in a magazine. Sure, you <em>can</em>, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you <em>should</em>.</p>

<p><strong>So what&#8217;s a web developer to do?</strong> When designs reach the desk of the CSS developer, more often than not they&#8217;ve been through so many rounds of review, revision, and approval &#8211; by people far-removed from the realities of the web &#8211; that the developer has little choice but to toil away at reproducing them faithfully.</p>

<p>The best defense may be a good offense, which is to say, the burden is on you, dear developer, to educate the misguided designers. Here are some tactics I&#8217;ve used:</p>

<ul>
<li>Impose yourself early in the process, insisting on wireframes and information architecture documents (even if they&#8217;re just sketches and an outline). Identify potential problems early on, but don&#8217;t become a naysayer &#8211; make sure you offer ideas, not just criticism.</li>
<li>Push back &#8211; gently but firmly &#8211; on design decisions that have the potential to cause problems down the road. Ask lots of &#8220;what if&#8221; questions and insist on answers.</li>
<li>Be honest about how long it will take you to accomplish a design &#8211; with yourself and with your boss or client &#8211; and identify opportunities to make cost-saving changes to the specifics of the design without changing its spirit.</li>
<li>Have examples at the ready of similar problems solved in more web-centric ways. The <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/">Yahoo! Design Patterns Library</a> can be an excellent resource for this, but look also to other sites in your industry or genre.</li>
</ul>


<p>The burden&#8217;s also on you to get better at CSS. I am lucky in that, when I first started playing around with web production, I was a little intimidated by tables. A background in print production steeped in templates and stylesheets made tables seem awkward and strange to me; CSS, temperamental as it was, at least bore some resemblance to the cascading style sheets of print production programs like Quark and InDesign.</p>

<p>These days, it&#8217;s rarer and rarer (but not unheard of) that I find myself beating my head against the wall over a CSS problem. I&#8217;ve learned HTML and CSS patterns that I reuse often, and I&#8217;ve learned to spot &#8211; and speak up about &#8211; design-induced ratholes. If you&#8217;re finding yourself sucked in by the latest round of CSS vs. tables debate, take heart, stand firm, and reconsider the source of your frustration.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just solved a problem where the <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation">jQuery validation plugin</a> wasn&#8217;t playing so nicely with <a href="http://wiki.moxiecode.com/index.php/TinyMCE:Index">TinyMCE</a> &#8211; the validation plugin was trying to validate the textarea before TinyMCE had a chance to copy the editor contents back to the textarea.

<p>And what do you know, it works. One note: it&#8217;s important to bind the content replacement to the click event of the submit button, not to the actual form submission, or else the validation may try to run before the content gets copied back to the textarea.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just wanted to call attention to two excellent posts by Benjamin Sterling: <a href="http://benjaminsterling.com/better-jquery-code-1/">Better jQuery Code 1</a> and <a href="http://benjaminsterling.com/better-jquery-code-2/">Better jQuery Code 2</a>. He offers some must-have tips on style, form and best practices. Thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/foobar2k">@foobar2k</a> for the link.</p>

<p>One addition to his notes on caching selections by setting up references: I&#8217;m partial to giving references a variable name that starts with a dollar sign, like $links. For me, it serves as a good reminder that the variable is a reference to a jQuery object.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A while back I wrote a post about tracking outbound clicks with Google Analytics; way back then (about 6 months ago), the only event that Google Analytics could track was a pageview. Now that they&#8217;ve introduced the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/eventTrackerOverview.html">_trackEvent</a> method of the pageTracker object, events that aren&#8217;t pageviews don&#8217;t need to count as pageviews anymore; instead, they can be counted as &#8220;events,&#8221; and they can be categorized and labeled.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s an updated example of how to track outbound clicks using Google Analytics and jQuery. You&#8217;ll of course need to be including the &#8220;new&#8221; analytics code (ga.js, not urchin.js) for this to work, as well as the jQuery library.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It just happened again: I was looking at someone else&#8217;s jQuery and I came across something like this:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;.button&#39;</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">click</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="cm">/* do something */</span> <span class="p">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This is a classic case of &#8220;just because you can, doesn&#8217;t mean you should.&#8221; This little bit of jQuery will, indeed, find every element on a page with a class of &#8220;button&#8221;, but that&#8217;s exactly the problem: it has to look at every element on the page to figure out which ones match the selector. It seems short and sweet, like so much of jQuery is, but on a page with a lot of elements, this selector can actually take a non-trivial amount of time to run.</p>

<p>There are a few ways to avoid this:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the element you&#8217;re after has an ID attribute, use it. That&#8217;s the single-fastest way to find an element. However, don&#8217;t gratuitously add ID attributes to elements; the other methods below are perfectly good.</li>
<li>Specify the type of element you&#8217;re after. For example, <code>$('input.button')</code>. This will tell jQuery that it&#8217;s only looking for inputs, so it can disregard anything on the page that isn&#8217;t an input. If you&#8217;re looking for multiple element types, tell jQuery that: <code>$('input.button, a.button')</code>
</li>
<li>Give jQuery some information about where to look for the element. For example: <code>$('#myForm .button')</code>
</li>
<li>Use an element you&#8217;ve already found to tell jQuery where to find the element:

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just spent more time than was reasonable trying to figure out why some Javascript I was using to show a Google map on one site wasn&#8217;t working to show the map on another site. The map controls and copyright were rendering, but there was no actual map.</p>

<p>Turns out the problem wasn&#8217;t with my Javascript; I had a CSS rule that was setting overflow:hidden on all divs within a container, and the divs created by the Google map API were getting that rule too. No good. I wrote a new CSS rule to set overflow:visible on all divs inside the map container &#8211; problem solved.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been spending a lot of time lately turning other people&#8217;s designs into working websites, and often there are a few rounds of back-and-forth before I have everything I need. Some notes on must-have pieces before I can begin work:</p>

<p><strong>Design</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>
<strong>Custom fonts. </strong>If the design includes fonts that aren&#8217;t on <a href="http://www.ampsoft.net/webdesign-l/WindowsMacFonts.html">this list</a>, then either the designer needs to provide a PSD that has all instances of the font being used in the design, or else I&#8217;m going to need the font file in order to create them. (There may be <a href="http://clagnut.com/blog/1798/">licensing</a> <a href="http://www.fsf.org/blogs/licensing/20050425novalis">issues</a> here, which I leave as an exercise for the reader. In print land, we were allowed to provide the print shop with the fonts required to produce a printed piece, and the print shop was not supposed to retain them once the print run was complete. I imagine something similar applies to web production.)</li>
    <li>
<strong>Navigation state information. </strong>What should navigation elements look like in the up, over, and current states? Ideally I&#8217;d like to see all of the buttons in each state, but if the variations are simple then I can probably make them myself.</li>
    <li>
<strong>Link state information.</strong> What color should links be? Should they be underlined all the time, or only on hover? What color should they be when they are hovered? When they&#8217;ve already been visited?</li>
    <li>
<strong>Form treatment.</strong> If the site has any forms on it, what should form elements &#8211; text inputs, submit buttons and input labels &#8211; look like?</li>
    <li>
<strong>Typography specifications.</strong> Decisions about these can dramatically affect the feel of the site, and you may not want to leave them up to me. Specifically:
<ul>
    <li>How big should body copy be?</li>
    <li>How much space should there be between body copy lines? (Normally the &#8220;line-height&#8221; is set at 1.2 times the size of the font; increasing this can make body copy more legible.)</li>
    <li>How much space should there be between body copy paragraphs?</li>
    <li>How should headings be styled? How big should primary and secondary headlines be relative to the body copy?</li>
    <li>How should lists (ordered and bulleted) be styled?</li>
</ul>
</li>
    <li>
<strong>Imagery specifications.</strong> Like typography specifications, these considerations should be made carefully, as they affect the feel of the site. Specifically:
<ul>
    <li>How should text wrap around an image? Should the image float to the left, with copy wrapping around the right? Float to the right, copy on the left? Leave it up to the user?</li>
    <li>If an image is floated to the left or right, how much space should be between it and the text?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Documentation</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>
<strong>Approved content documents.</strong> Personally I prefer a single content document per static page that needs to be created, and a content sample for any dynamic pages that will need to be created. If there are any repeating elements in the design that require content, I&#8217;d enjoy getting a document that contains their text as well. Lastly, if there are any dynamically generated content items &#8211; for example, a list of latest posts &#8211; I&#8217;d like a document that shows me how these should be formatted. This will help me:
<ul>
    <li>Make sure I&#8217;ve accounted for the pieces of the content and how they fit together.</li>
    <li>Know that all content has been considered, reviewed and approved, so there shouldn&#8217;t be too many surprises later.</li>
    <li>Reconcile the content documents with any other documentation I&#8217;ve received.</li>
</ul>
</li>
    <li>
<strong>Functional spec document. </strong>Let me know what should happen when someone fills out a form. Let me know how the items in the sidebar should be gathered. Let me know where that video&#8217;s going to come from. Basically, anytime I ask &#8220;Where does that come from?&#8221; or &#8220;What does this do?&#8221;, the functional spec should answer that question. While a functional spec should be initiated long before the design is complete, it is good to review the design and make sure those questions are answered. A functional spec should also include a sitemap.</li>
</ul>
