Select a layer and hold Alt, then click on the garbage can button. It
will instantly delete the layer, marquee where you want alpha and
Ctrl+click the "Create new channel" button, it will create an alpha
only on the area you marquee.<br /><br />33. File&gt; Automate &gt; Contact
Sheet: this can create a small thumbnail for every file, this can save
you some time from searching.<br /><br />34. When Move Tool is selected,
toolbox on top can be useful from time to time, these are "Auto select
layer" and "Show bounding box".<br /><br />35. While Move Tool is selected,
hold Shift (Alt+Shift+Right click) and allow whether or not to make a
current layer chain with your upper layer.<br /><br />36. With grid on,
click the top left corner of the grid and drag to anywhere on the image
to set the pivot, double clicking on the icon again reset the pivot.<br /><br />37. After, draw a path on the image with pen tool, Ctrl+shift+H can hide/show it.<br /><br />38. Control Navigator with keyboard sometimes can be more time efficient than mouse.<br /><br />***<br /><br />Home = move to top left corner<br />End = move to right bottom corner<br />PageUp = move up one page<br />PageDown = move down one page<br />Ctrl+PageUp = move left one page<br />Ctrl+PageDown = move right one page<br />Shift+PageUp = move up 10 pixel<br />Shift+PageDown = move down 10 pixel<br />Ctrl+Shift+PageUp = move left 10 pixel<br />Ctrl+Shift+PageDown = move right 10 pixel<br /><br /><br />39. Ctrl+Tab allows you to switch between different image files you are working on.<br /><br /><br />40. F12 = Revert to how the file was the last time you saved it.<br /><br /><br />41. Shortcuts for Channel: RGB, CMYK, indexed color...<br /><br />***<br /><br />Ctrl+"~" = RGB<br />Ctrl+1 = red<br />Ctrl+2 = green<br />Ctrl+3 = blue<br />Ctrl+4 = other path<br />Ctrl+9 = other path<br />Ctrl+"~" = CMYK<br />Ctrl+1 = light green<br />Ctrl+2 = pink red<br />Ctrl+3 = yellow<br />Ctrl+4 = black<br />Ctrl+5 = other path<br />Ctrl+9 = other path<br />Ctrl+1 = Indexed<br />Ctrl+2 = other path<br />Ctrl+9 = other path<br /><br />42. hold Ctrl then you can draw a red box in the Navigator thumbnail for viewing.<br /><br />43. Hold Alt and click on any of the history steps, that step will be copied and become the most recent one.<br /><br />44. Alt drag a step from a serial action can copy it to another action.<br /><br />45. Alt-click the flare preview thumb, and you can fill in numerical co-ordinates for lens flare.<br /><br />46. Holding Shift + Alt while transforming an object will do it proportionally, from the center.<br /><br />47.
If you have the move tool selected and you want something duplicated
just hold the alt key and move the image, holding the Shift + Alt while
doing this, it will move it along one axis.<br /><br />48. If you want to
straighten an image that is crooked (maybe from scanning), click on the
eyedropper tool or hit the I key 3 times to get the ruler. Click on the
left side of the straight edge, then the right side of the straight
(but crooked) edge. The choose Image&gt; Rotate Canvas&gt; Arbitrary,
Photoshop will give you the degrees of rotation you just click ok.<br /><br />49.
If you create something in Illustrator, copy and paste it in Photoshop,
it will ask you if you want this to be a pixel, path, or shape layer.<br /><br />50.
If you have a mask on a layer and you want to place a image in there
and keep the mask. Simply open the image, say copy, and then Ctrl click
on the layer to select the mask and use Shift + Ctrl + V to paste it
into the mask which will also put it on a new layer as well.<br /><br />51. To center an image, Ctrl + A , Ctrl + X, Ctrl + V, I think it also puts that image on a new layer.<br /><br />52. Ctrl+E will merge the highlighted layer down to the next<br /><br />53. When you have a brush selected, using [ or ] will scroll up or down that brush list.<br /><br />54.
Double clicking the zoom tool will make the image 100%, double clicking
the hand tool will fit the image to your screen resolution.<br />55. Typing Content:<br /><br />Ctrl + H will hide the highlight on your selected type.<br /><br />If
you click once while your type is selected on the font list, you can
use your arrows to scroll up and down and see the fonts change on the
fly!<br /><br />Alt + Left or Right arrows will change your tracking in increments of 10<br />Ctrl + Alt + Left or Right arrows will change your tracking in increments of 100<br />Ctrl + Alt + Up or Down arrows will change your leading in increments of 10 pts<br />Shift + Ctrl with &lt; or &gt; will change your font size in increments of 2 pts<br /><br />56. Ctrl + Alt + T to make a copy of the layer in which you want to transform.<br /><br />57. Ctrl + Alt + Right arrow. duplicates the layer you are on.<br /><br />58. Change the active layer : Alt + [ or ].<br /><br />59. Move the active layer up and down : Ctrl + [ or ].<br /><br />60. Link 2 layers: with move tool click in the first layer hold Shift and click in the second one.<br /><br />61.
Ctrl+[plus key] will let you zoom in on an image anytime while
Ctrl+[minus key] zooms out. Ctrl+Alt+[plus key] will zoom in AND RESIZE
the window to fit the image size... same for Ctrl+Alt+[minus key] as
well.<br /><br />62. When using the Polygonal Lasso Tool, click backspace to undo a lasso step.<br /><br />63. Pressing X will switch the selected foreground and background colors.<br /><br />64. Pressing D will reset the foreground and backgrounds colors to black and white.<br /><br />65.
If your image has multiple layers, create a Marquee selection and press
Ctrl+Shift+Cit won't work if you selected a hidden layer) will copy the
image into memory as if they were flattened! Paste it on a new document
to see the result.<br /><br />66. Ctrl+Alt+Z will do multiple undo, versus just one.<br /><br />67. Ctrl+click a layer thumbnail to select the layer transparency<br /><br />68. To see what your layer mask looks like (and edit it), Alt+click its thumbnail in the layers palette<br /><br />69.
Press and hold Ctrl+Alt and click the Help bar with your mouse, drag it
down and highlight "About Photoshop" and let go of the left mouse
button for a different About Photoshop splash/screen.<br /><br />70. When using Polygon lasso tool hold Shift to make a perfect line, it goes every 30 degrees<br /><br />71.Photoshop
CS2: Group many layers by clicking the layers you want to group by
clicking it while holding the Shift key down, and then press Ctrl+G to
group them into a folder for means of better organization.<br /><br />72. Ctrl+Shift+N creates a new layer with a dialog box; Ctrl+Shift+Alt+N gets you a new layer without the hassle.<br /><br />73. Back to brush, [ and ] will increase/decrease your brush size, Shift + [ or ] will soften or harden your brush edge.<br /><br />74.
Still in [ and ], Ctrl + [ or ] will move your currently selected layer
up and down the hierarchy and Shift + [ or ] will select upper layer or
lower layer.<br /><br />75. Stamp Tool (s) is used to copy an area of image
(defined by alt+clicking and area) and paint it somewhere else
(cloning). It also works when you have multiple images open at the same
time. Alt click an area of any opened file image and paint it anywhere
else.<br /><br />76. After you created a text you can click on font type
tab and tap "down" key over and over to scroll through the font list
and see the changes in (relatively) real time. A feature that I am
tired of waiting to happen in illustrator.<br /><br />77. Still in text
mode, a trick from Microsoft word to apply hi-light to your text hit
Ctrl+Shift+ &lt; or &gt; to resize your text, to your preferred font
size. Pressing Ctrl key while you are typing also gives you a free
transform box temporarily and will go if you release it. Resizing text
also works by pressing Ctrl+T (on selected layer, not when you are
typing). It still retains as an editable text layer after.<br /><br />78.
And remember, pressing enter when you type will take you to a new line
just like typing a letter but pressing Ctrl+Enter or Enter on numeric
key will finish what you type.<br /><br />79. You can drag a layer on to
any other opened images in Photoshop and it will copy it as a layer
(better than copy and paste image). Holding down Shift while moving it
will snap the image right on the center of the other opened image<br /><br />80. If you are working with sets....<br /><br />Click
on the set, in the blending mode it shows pass through by default... if
you have an adjustment layer within a set and you want that adjustment
layer to effect those layers underneath it within the set only, set the
blending mode of the set to "normal" instead.<br /><br />CODE<br /><br /><br />Mentioned before with more explanation:<br /><br />-
Pressed F to switch to 3 different viewing mode... when I first try it
I said "wtf? what it's for?" Well, if you are sick of painting your
image on the corners just to find yourself resizing your current image
window, with F you can pan way outside your image. Happy corner
painting!!<br /><br /><br />- Create a new file, 500x500 px, create a new
layer, get a standard brush and paint a dot on the top center of your
image (like the number 12 position on a clock). Press Ctrl+Alt+T, it
will duplicate your original layer and free transform the new one. Move
the pivot point (the circle with little dot in it found when you are
free transforming something) to the center of your image, rotate your
image 30 degrees to the right and hit OK to confirm the transform<br /><br />now.........<br /><br /><br />Be excited..........<br /><br /><br />Hit Ctrl+Shift+Alt+T 10 times and see what happens!<br /><br />81.
When using the "move tool" you can select any layer by holding down the
CTL key(CMD on a Mac) and clicking on the part of the layer on the
canvas with your mouse. This way you won't have to go to the Layers
palette every time and you don't have to keep checking on or off the
auto select options for the move tool.<br /><br />82. You can link up
layers without going into the layers palette, by selecting the layer
(how I just mentioned above) and holding down CTL + Shift(CMD + SHIT on
a Mac) for each additional layer you want to link up. You can unlink
them by clicking on the layer again.<br /><br />83. You can delete more
than one layer at a time.......by linking up all the layer you want to
delete, and holding down CTL(CMD on a Mac) while you click on the
garbage icon to delete the layer.<br /><br />84. When using the type tool
you can ok it by pressing CTL + Enter(CMD + Enter on a Mac) instead of
clicking on the check mark on the options.<br /><br />85. If you have more
than one type layer, and want to make any of the following changes
color/font/size/alignment/initializing to all of the type layers at the
same time.....All you have to do is link up the type layer, hold down
the Shift key and in the options for the type tool make your change
i.e. color, size, etc.<br /><br />86. You can use your number pad to change
opacity for a layer.... I.e. type 5 and the opacity will be 50; type 55
and the opacity will be 55. You can use the number pad for any tool
that uses opacity...like the airbrush tool, stamp tool, brush,
gradient, etc.<br /><br />87. Pressing Tab key will hide the Tools palette
and any other palette that you have on the stage. Pressing "F" will
change between Full Screen modes. Using these two tips you can view
your work Full Screen without any palettes.(You can press CTL+Alt+0 to
fit your work to the screen, or you can press CTL+0 to zoom to 100%)<br /><br />88. Pressing the "+" and "-" keys while holding down CTL+Alt will resize the whole document window, not just the work area.<br /><br />89.
You can delete a layer by holding down the "Alt" key and pressing "L"
twice......actually now with Photoshop 7 you got to press "L" three
times. It's not actually a keyboard shortcut, but it's a quick way to
do it....don't know if it works on a MAC.<br /><br />90. Pan documents with the space bar.<br /><br />91. Ctrl+click a layer (in layers palette) to select it's transparency.<br /><br />92. Ctrl+Alt+click between 2 layers in the palette to group them.<br /><br />93. Alt + click in “add layer mask” button to add a black layer mask (instead of a white one).<br /><br />94.
When you select something, pressing Ctrl+J will copy the selected area
and add another layer with the copied area - opposing copying the
layer, making a new layer, and pasting it.<br /><br />95. To glue the
palettes together (all palettes combined into one strip), you just drag
&amp; drop a palette onto the end of another palette (watch the
rectangle that indicates where the palette will get attached to).<br /><br />96. Hold down Alt while Burning to Dodge instead, and vice versa.<br /><br />97.
Ctrl-click a layer to select an objects; alternatively, you may select
more than one object/s in more than 1 layer by holding Shift while
using the method just mentioned (Ctrl-click). To deselect, just press
Ctrl+D.<br /><br />98. If you have a mini scroll on your mouse, you may use that to zoom in (scroll up) or zoom out (scroll down).<br /><br />99.
Need to locate a layer quick? Use the Move Tool (V) and right click on
the area the object lays. There should now be a “cursor-menu” with all
the layers that is in that particular area. Now take a good guess and
see which one of them fits the shoe; select a layer and Ctrl-Click the
layer in the Layer Palette - see if the selection traces the object you
desired to edit/find. Useful for those messy people (i.e. me!).<br /><br />100.
Need to get rid of a background quick? Assuming you at least know how
to crop around an object, do so. Now press Ctrl+I or Shift+Ctrl+I for
Inverse Selection. Press Ctrl+X to %@#!* that part out, and you should
be left with the object!<br /><br />101. Want to save the time from loading
All your Photoshop brushes, when your Photoshop accidentally forgets to
load them up (happens to me sometimes)? Select the brush tool, and
click the little arrow pointing right (located at the top toolbar),
next to the Master Diameter tick. Go down to Preset Manager and now
there should be a menu of all the brushes currently loaded. Click on
the first brush (top left) and scroll down to the bottom. Now hold
Shift and click the last brush (bottom right). This should highlight
all the brushes. See the “Save Set” to the right in the menu? Click
that and name your brush set whatever you want, for this matter I just
name it All (so I remember that this brush set contains all the brushes
I currently have loaded, and is located near the top when loading the
brushes up).<br /><br /><p class="poweredbyperformancing">Powered by <a href="http://scribefire.com/">ScribeFire</a>.</p>
