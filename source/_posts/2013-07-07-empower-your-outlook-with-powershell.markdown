I will soon share code with the world

{% gist 5944505 %}

Above code is used to select a folder under your outlook inbox in my case its jun 2013 which comes under EmailLog which is under my inbox. I have saved the result of this function into a variable. That would be passed into second function for html creation. 

{% gist 5944515 %}

This funciton will take email objects and wrap html mark around thema before saving them into a html file.
