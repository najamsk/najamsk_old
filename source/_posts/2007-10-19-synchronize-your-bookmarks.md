Surrounded by computers and internet all the time when at work, in university labs or when browsing internet from your home. During long sessions we come across some really good websites and <a href="http://www,najamsikander.com">solutions</a> and add them to our bookmarks but as soon as you switch PC your favorites bookmarks are gone. Its very difficult to manage your bookmarks on multiple PC's but not anymore if you are a firefox fan. One can easily synchronize his/her bookmars by installing a little extension called foxmarks and signing up for an account in <a href="http://www.foxmarks.com" title="Signup Today For Free">foxmarks.com</a>. You probable already know about other solutions like google browser sync and <a href="http://del.icio.us/" title="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> but both of them are very heavy for a dial up user with a distortion in phone line where foxmarks works like a breeze.

Try foxmarks extension for yourself and give me your feedback on this post.

Bye Everyone

thanks for reading :)
