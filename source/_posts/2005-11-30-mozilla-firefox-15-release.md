Firefox version 1.5 released today I have downloaded this latest version from http//:www.mozila.org

New features include a drag and drop for tabbed browsing, a better pop up blocker algorithm, and a reference search engine which includes answer.com, a better live bookmark feature, and an improved option interface.

The software also includes an auto update system when security patches need to be applied or additional features become available.

Mozilla also said that performance is better because of a next generation  rendering and layout engine. Mozilla said there are now 700 extensions to Firefox. More are expected in the coming weeks.
