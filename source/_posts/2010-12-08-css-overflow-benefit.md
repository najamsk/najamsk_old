I read this article <a href="http://bit.ly/16pqBm">http://bit.ly/16pqBm</a> and find out the power of overflow that is when you set it to a value it creates a new block formatting context in simple word that means non floated element’s content will not flow around the floated element instead will get narrower.

PS. Width should not be mentioned for non floated content so it can get narrower.
