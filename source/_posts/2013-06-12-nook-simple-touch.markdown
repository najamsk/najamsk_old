I like to read books mostly on programming topics in my opinion  the best reading experience is in form of print but it's expensive and hard to mange so after reading books on laptop I googled for a economic e-book reader. 

I was puzzled between kindle and nook devices after reading reviews and considering the price I went for [Nook Simple Touch](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/p/nook-simple-touch-barnes-noble/1102344735) other than price its battery life was big plus to me.

I have large collection of free e-books few of them are living in my nook and I am reading them experience is not that great as compare to actual book but it gets the job done.

One problem I faced just after I get nook was screen damage. It started with a line in bottom and than it gradually expand I don't how it got damage. Since nook doesn't operate in Pakistan so I had to sent it back to usa via my friends and they claim warranty and they send it back to me using some other friend.
