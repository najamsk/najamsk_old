hi everyone

I am posting after a long time guess I was super busy :) well first things first I have installed wordpress 2.7 on my hosting and imported all the data from my blog running at http://najam.wordpress.com.

Now a days I am busy with developing themes with wordpress and since I am stuck with windows wamp is a choice for me. One problem I run into is if I try to put custom structure for my permalinks to have more seo friendly blog it fails to show the post or page :( . Anyone know whats the problem? And even if I do this for this blog you reading it would fail to show the page/post that includes the front page.
