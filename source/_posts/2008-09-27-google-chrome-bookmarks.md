hi friends

You know google chrome is out and everyone was so excited about that including me as a very passionate user i tried to do all of the things now in chrome i have imported my firefox settings (bookmarks) into chrome. All bookmarks are showing good I liked that but shortly I needed to perform a simple task in chrome that is "searching for a bookmarked site among all the bookmarks i have" and till now i don't know how to search for my bookmark in mighty chrome.

So if anyone of you know how to seach bookmarks in chrome please let me know. And one more thing what about tags how can I tag my pages?
