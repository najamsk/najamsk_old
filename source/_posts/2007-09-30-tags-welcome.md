With wordpress 2.3 codename dexter wordpress bloggers finally have their hands on most waited features <strong>"Tags". </strong>Tags are very much like categories but little convenient  then categories. Tags come handy when you are posting and you can put tags onto your post by just typing tag name and comma separate them whereas if you want post under multiple categories you have to select the check boxes for that.<span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman';">  </span>
