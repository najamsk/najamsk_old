Hi guyz,

After many days I am back and back for good :) recentlly i purchased a domain name and hosting package, so that i can have my own <a href="http://najamsikander.com" title="Visit my Website now.">website</a> and I want my settings persistent which was not possible in the case of free hosting like in my case my hosting provider remove the mysql database support.

Can't tell you how happy I am after getting my <a href="http://najamsikander.com" title="Visit my Website now.">website</a> up and running its currently in beta state I will design it from scratch as time permits and planning to use table less design. With my <a href="http://najamsikander.com" title="Visit my Website now.">website</a> I have configured a wordpress blog and currently its using a template that I pick form internet after designing my main <a href="http://najamsikander.com" title="Visit my Website now.">website</a> I will design my own wordpress template.

Below is the screen shot of my new <a href="http://najamsikander.com" title="Visit my Website now.">website</a>.
