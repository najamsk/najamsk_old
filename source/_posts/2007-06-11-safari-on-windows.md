hi guyz
believe or not safari famous apple browser new beta version is here for both mac and windows users yes u heard it all right its for windows too i have downloaded it and installed it and it works great for me.

Since i never used it and i am a big fan of firefox i am finding a little difficulty to find the features i am used to with like a home page icon history cleaner,no enter or go button,full screen and how to auto complete url for .com and other domains.

I guess it will take time to get used to with that but one thing is for sure this is very good move made by apple they should launch more products for window users.
