    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have been involved with development of small and large web applications for quite sometime now. While using latest tools and technology for development I always felt my workflow is from ancient times. Recently I got much obsessed with automation, I thought to improve my development workflow. In my mind I knew I need to do something about build process, tests the build, deployment of latest build and notify team members that new code/build is available.</p>

<p>I started looking around, playing with tools from different vendors and finally shortlisted few tools to start with. Following tools made the list.</p>

<ul>
<li>PowerShell</li>
<li>Slack</li>
<li>GitLab</li>
<li>TeamCity</li>
<li>Octopus Deployment</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>If you are thinking wow it&#8217;s alot to get started with automation then I will recommond learning Powershell if your using windows and .Net technologies. With Powershell only you can do most of things I am about to share with you.</strong></p>

<h2>Sprint Killings</h2>

<p>We are using scrum for development with two week sprint cycle to get things out. Short sprints have their benefits but they also kills, if you are doing testing and deployment manually and this pain reaches to maximum intensity if you need to to push code to multiple servers (Dev, QA, Staging, Production).</p>

<p><img src="http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/enhanced/webdr01/2013/2/20/17/anigif_enhanced-buzz-4131-1361399397-4.gif"/></p>

<p>We have been using some tooling while writing code and communicating with each other and that was not modern and did hurt us after a while. Following list contains few common tools in use by our local industry:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>TFS and SVN</strong> - for version control</li>
<li>__Vychat &amp; skype - for communication</li>
<li><strong>Zero unit tests</strong> - (well few devs were submiting their forms to check output and called that unit testing. I am not joking.)</li>
<li><strong>Zero integration tests</strong> (Again manual process followed by Devs and QA)</li>
<li><strong>Deployment using filezilla</strong> (Yes this is the holy grail of deployment)</li>
</ul>


<p>Few team members had major issues with SVN and TFS as souce control specially when they are not using windows. Since I have been using Git for sometime now and loved it. I recommonded git and knew we can&#8217;t move ahead without installing local git server. After some research found GitLab that has free option available. We are running GitLab on ubuntu 12.04 box and untill now it&#8217;s working smoothly.</p>

<p>Co-workers that got beatings from SVN fall in love with git and we all thought it&#8217;s the only change we needed in our current workflow/tooling. Well that was a mistake.</p>

<p><img src="http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/enhanced/webdr02/2013/2/8/14/anigif_enhanced-buzz-11517-1360352639-1.gif" /></p>

<h4>Problem 1: Who Moved The Code?</h4>

<p>&#8220;Is it ok to pull latest code from remote branch?&#8221;. Gitlab was providing us information about what changed in latest commit and by whom but couldn&#8217;t signal us if the code is free from compile time errors. That created fear among devs and they came up with a solution called <strong>&#8220;Push-Pa&#8221;</strong>.</p>

<h6>Manual Solution: Push-Pa</h6>

<p>To solve above problem our team agreed to follow a process which dictates that before pushing your code to version control make sure you pull the code first merge it with your local changes. Compile the merged code, test it to check every feature is still working and than push it to remote branch.</p>

<p>Compiling code is no rocket science but it was painful to do it manually against each commit. Team started to feel the burden but keeps doing it in fact they name this push-pull exercise as &#8220;Push-Pa&#8221;.</p>

<h6>Real Solution: Teamcity</h6>

<p>I knew Teamcity for a while and used it against TFS source control for a big web forms based web application. At that time I was using it against TFS and to get notifications if latest commit compiles without errors.</p>

<p>Since we are using GitLab now for latest projects first task at hand was how to integrate Teamcity with Gitlab server for monitoring latest commits in a specific branch.</p>

<h4>Problem 2: Deployment Nightmare</h4>

<p>Our deployment process was from 80&#8217;s or 90&#8217;s if ftp exist back then. For deployment first step was to pull the latest code from source control. Then make changes for server environment (if you miss transforms, and environment checks) in config files and other code which is specific to server environment. Once that&#8217;s done create a zip file and upload it to server via ftp.</p>

<p>On server we need to unzip the latest code, and create backup of running website. Then overwrite files and test to see if deployment works. If its failing restore the backup, if it works pray to God and say thanks for the blessings.</p>

<p><img src="http://25.media.tumblr.com/18f10fa837406181e2b43e1680187bb6/tumblr_mpg1oe3dK21qjmdwqo1_500.gif" /></p>

<h6>Solution: Octopus Deploy</h6>

<p>There are many solutions out there to handle deployments some bundled with integration feature. In few talks related to devops I came across Octopus Deploy. It felt nice, easy and powerful best part was they were targeting .net devs with slogan <strong>&#8220;Automated deployment for .NEt&#8221;</strong>.</p>

<p>Our team currently testing Octopus Deploy and it&#8217;s linked with our Teamcity server. It takes the Teamcity compiled output/package and transform the code and settings for our deployment servers. Once code is modified for web servers its uploaded and deployed automatically. Backup against each deployment is managed by Octopus Deploy, you can roll back to preview release anytime you want.</p>

<p>Configurations and integrating Octopus server with Teamcity and Gitlab was little hard but I got minimal setup working in fair amount of time. Now its much easier to deploy code and we can develop our project faster, push small changes/fixes frequently while keeping our sanity intact.</p>

<h4>Problem 3: Are We There Yet?</h4>

<p>Achieving continuous deployment was fun and I felt good about it, but one problem was still sticking around. Team asking each other if latest code has been deployed I could have setup emails notification on Teamcity and Octopus but knew different people value email differently. Some will wait for it and read it to get latest updates some will apply filter so these kind of emails skip their inbox.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.giphy.com/media/XUR9XH8olimic/giphy.gif" /></p>

<p>In my view having these updates inside team chat room was the best option but it&#8217;s hard to integrate notifications with vychat or skype. This is why my first mission was to convert each member to slack and enforce everyone is using it. (still working on that front)</p>

<h6>Solution: Slack</h6>

<p>Slack offers integration points and rest API, using their API our Octopus server pushes updates about deployment like if deployment is successful or failed. After deployment notification another notification about same release updates team chat room for smoke tests(Powershell scripts) status.</p>

<h6>Problem 4: Smoke Testing</h6>

<p>Our current web application under development has many pages of different nature like public pages, secure pages, redirect pages and error pages.</p>

<p>One time we got complaint that one or two public pages are not working for users. Another time pages that suppose to be secure and ask for user credentials were open to everyone. Even though we have QA department and they take proper time to test still these issues could have crawled back.</p>

<h6>Solution: PowerShell</h6>

<p>To avoid future complaints in this area I have developed a Powershell script that has list of pages (public, secure, 404, 500) and it make requests to those pages and according to response it pushes notifications to slack. That Powershell script is executed by Octopus on remote server after each deployment.</p>

<p><img src="http://33.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m2yyycfgnj1r2optzo1_500.gif"/></p>

<h3>Environment</h3>

<p>We have made modifications to our local IT infrastructure we have some new servers that are running Gitlab, Teamcity and Octopus deploy. Gitlab is configured on Ubuntu 12.04 box for rest of the tools we are using windows platform.</p>

<p>Download Teamcity and Octopus Deploy setups files from following:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/download/">TeamCity Setup</a></li>
<li><a href="https://Octopusdeploy.com/downloads">Octopus Deploy Sever</a></li>
<li><a href="https://Octopusdeploy.com/downloads">Octopus Deploy Tentacle</a></li>
<li><a href="https://Octopusdeploy.com/downloads">Ocotpus Deploy Teamcity Plugin</a></li>
</ul>


<h3>Installing Teamcity</h3>

<p>Installation is fairly simple and for database I wanted to use Microsoft SQL Server.Teamcity installation wizard guides you to <a href="http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCD9/Setting+up+an+External+Database#SettingupanExternalDatabase-MicrosoftSQLServer">download SQL JDBC driver</a>. Unzip the file and look for a file <em>4.0.jar</em> copy this file to lib folder of Teamcity installation directory.</p>

<p>Now check your Teamcity installation wizard and test if drivers are loaded. If there are no errors you can now specify connection detail for your sql server database.</p>

<p>After database setup Teamcity will prompt you for terms and conditions and then ask you to create admin account.</p>

<h4>Creating Build: Gitlab</h4>

<p>First thing is to create a new project, next choose create build configuration for your new project. Since source is on GitLab you need to check version control settings inside Teamcity. Make sure your settings are similar to mine.</p>

<p><a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-gawLVzorkio/VK08JhJiFNI/AAAAAAAADkQ/6Wz8eiDJSn4/s2560/Edit-VCS-Root----TeamCity.jpg" title="version control settings">
<img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-HgycLiQB-VE/VK08HN9MQ3I/AAAAAAAADjk/RzN8533XJkI/s2560/Create-Build-Configuration-%E2%80%94-TeamCity.jpg"/>
</a></p>

<p><a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-gawLVzorkio/VK08JhJiFNI/AAAAAAAADkQ/6Wz8eiDJSn4/s2560/Edit-VCS-Root----TeamCity.jpg" title="version control settings">
<img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-gawLVzorkio/VK08JhJiFNI/AAAAAAAADkQ/6Wz8eiDJSn4/s2560/Edit-VCS-Root----TeamCity.jpg" title="version control settings" /></a></p>

<p>You might tell from screenshot that our team city build will monitor dev branch of our project and as soon as new commit will arrive we will be notified to process it.</p>

<p>Now we need to configure build steps right now I only have two build steps that downloads the code of latest commit and compiles it using the method I have choose. Second step will package the compiled code and pass it on to Octopus Deployment. You can see my build step configuration from following screenshot.</p>

<p><a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/--M2by-kAbPA/VK08NzqncBI/AAAAAAAADlA/vO2a0vnO9kE/s2560/jsp-Dev-Configuration----TeamCity_build_step.jpg"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/--M2by-kAbPA/VK08NzqncBI/AAAAAAAADlA/vO2a0vnO9kE/s2560/jsp-Dev-Configuration----TeamCity_build_step.jpg" /></a></p>

<p><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-UE-hPQxWaFM/VK08NeMJOqI/AAAAAAAADk8/OwzNLBeQ9fk/s2560/jsp-Dev-Configuration----TeamCityOctopus.jpg">
<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-UE-hPQxWaFM/VK08NeMJOqI/AAAAAAAADk8/OwzNLBeQ9fk/s2560/jsp-Dev-Configuration----TeamCityOctopus.jpg" />
</a></p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t see OctoPack section yet with your Teamcity installation you need to install OctoPack plugin. Installation is dead simple copy Octopus.TeamCity.zip into Teamcity plugins folder (C:\ProgramData\JetBrains\TeamCity\plugins) then restart Teamciy windows service and refresh your browser you will have OctoPack section like screenshot.
<a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Kk6UsR-yd-8/VK08Ij1p8iI/AAAAAAAADj4/9TOuhJi_2S0/s2560/Diagnostics---Browse-Data-Directory-%E2%80%94-TeamCity.jpg">
<img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Kk6UsR-yd-8/VK08Ij1p8iI/AAAAAAAADj4/9TOuhJi_2S0/s2560/Diagnostics---Browse-Data-Directory-%E2%80%94-TeamCity.jpg" />
</a></p>

<p><a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-8051eiR2hqQ/VK08LJR0S0I/AAAAAAAADkk/wIEO5eM3Rx8/s2560/Plugins-List-%E2%80%94-TeamCity.jpg">
<img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-8051eiR2hqQ/VK08LJR0S0I/AAAAAAAADkk/wIEO5eM3Rx8/s2560/Plugins-List-%E2%80%94-TeamCity.jpg" />
</a></p>

<h3>Installing OctoPack</h3>

<p>Installation is dead simple once you have installed the Octopus Deploy server. You can run a tentacle setup on any deployment server (Staging, Testing, Production).</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s configure our project inside Octopus Deploy now. Create a new project and name it.</p>

<p>Create a new environment and make sure add your tentacle or deployment server to that environment. I have one environment called development but later on I will add more like staging and production.
<a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-7BkVrcQkcc4/VK08HwRAiKI/AAAAAAAADj0/DNP6ANsOWvk/s2560/Development-settings---Octopus-Deploy.jpg">
<img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-7BkVrcQkcc4/VK08HwRAiKI/AAAAAAAADj0/DNP6ANsOWvk/s2560/Development-settings---Octopus-Deploy.jpg" />
</a></p>

<p>To integrate Octopus Deploy with Teamcity we need to create an API key. API keys are tied to Octopus Deploy user so you can create key by visiting users than pick a user and you will see a link to create new key.</p>

<p><a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Vsfpjoi1idE/VMiO7qVZVMI/AAAAAAAADmw/RU30d6zCt44/s2560/octopuskey.png">
<img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Vsfpjoi1idE/VMiO7qVZVMI/AAAAAAAADmw/RU30d6zCt44/s2560/octopuskey.png" />
</a></p>

<p>We need to tell Octopus how to download Teamcity output for that you need to visit back Teamcity and configure a nuget feed. Goto teamcity administration area on left sidebar under integrations heading you will see a link called nuget click on it for configuration.</p>

<p><a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-1rAGhlGhSg4/VMiO6_nhiOI/AAAAAAAADnE/oSGpIxXpsxQ/s2560/NuGetfeed.png">
<img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-1rAGhlGhSg4/VMiO6_nhiOI/AAAAAAAADnE/oSGpIxXpsxQ/s2560/NuGetfeed.png" />
</a></p>

<p>Now you need to add that feed inside Octopus Deploy you can do that from inside Octopus Deploy dashboard. Simply click on library link from top navigation bar then you will see a link &#8220;External Feeds&#8221; on left sidebar. External feeds link will allow us to add teamcity feed and test it. For testing click on the test link and on new page you will see a search field and a search button. Click on search button and you will get results from teamcity.</p>

<p><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ZrS1eC9f-b4/VMiO69Nu5xI/AAAAAAAADm8/tuUaJ8TTbCU/s2560/octopusFeedArea.png">
<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ZrS1eC9f-b4/VMiO69Nu5xI/AAAAAAAADm8/tuUaJ8TTbCU/s2560/octopusFeedArea.png" />
</a></p>

<p>While are pieces of puzzle are in their place we can now define the deployment process for our project. Octopus Deploy breaks process into steps that you need to define and configured.</p>

<p><a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-QgCOHh426Qo/VK08KQ8becI/AAAAAAAADkU/JRsK-3fkc6w/s2560/JumpstartPakistan-deployment-process---Octopus-Deploy.jpg">
<img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-QgCOHh426Qo/VK08KQ8becI/AAAAAAAADkU/JRsK-3fkc6w/s2560/JumpstartPakistan-deployment-process---Octopus-Deploy.jpg" />
</a></p>

<p><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-izLzdy0drnQ/VK08HOYFABI/AAAAAAAADjs/4hTmdXlhWy4/s2560/Deploy---Octopus-Deploy_step_deploy.jpg">
<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-izLzdy0drnQ/VK08HOYFABI/AAAAAAAADjs/4hTmdXlhWy4/s2560/Deploy---Octopus-Deploy_step_deploy.jpg" />
</a></p>

<p>We start with our first step called deploy and like it&#8217;s name it deploys the latest build from Teamcity to any environment we have pick.</p>

<h4>Slack Notifications</h4>

<p>By this time you should be able to have a pipeline connecting your gitlab server to your deployment server using Teamcity and Octopus Deploy. It&#8217;s time to inform team that new build has been deployed. To configure slack with Octopus deploy you need to visit Octopus Deploy dashboard again and click on library. On left sidebar click on &#8220;Step templates&#8221; link and than on top menu you will see another link &#8220;import step template&#8221;. Octopus deploy has a community library and from there I have imported <a href="https://library.octopusdeploy.com/#!/step-template/actiontemplate-slack-notify-deployment">Slack Integration script</a>.</p>

<p>Now you can add a new step into your process defined earlier. Follow screenshots to match my configuration.</p>

<p><a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-6jnog1nSD_o/VMiO746dWxI/AAAAAAAADm0/_5BZIBGETq4/s2560/slackImport.png">
<img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-6jnog1nSD_o/VMiO746dWxI/AAAAAAAADm0/_5BZIBGETq4/s2560/slackImport.png" />
</a></p>

<p><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-hVW5n-d_bqI/VMiO79o1qDI/AAAAAAAADnI/jqse1muUppk/s2560/slackDetails.png">
<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-hVW5n-d_bqI/VMiO79o1qDI/AAAAAAAADnI/jqse1muUppk/s2560/slackDetails.png" />
</a></p>

<h4>Smoke Testing Deployment</h4>

<p>Remember the problem I have mentioned earlier in this post about some pages slip through QA and I solved that by writing Powershell script. Well running that test script manually was not good enough. I configured my process to run Powershell script for testing pages and announce the result of test in slack. Follow the screenshots for my configurations.</p>

<p><a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-VNbGYhdpY1g/VMiRVkcUg6I/AAAAAAAADnY/_Ya_JCidGjM/s2560/octopussmoke.png">
<img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-VNbGYhdpY1g/VMiRVkcUg6I/AAAAAAAADnY/_Ya_JCidGjM/s2560/octopussmoke.png" />
</a></p>

<h3>Test Run</h3>

<p>I have recorded a screencast for whole thing in action so you have better understanding of what we achieved.</p>

<h3>What&#8217;s Next</h3>

<p><img src="http://media.giphy.com/media/c3LrSypJkaj0A/giphy.gif" /></p>

<ul>
<li>I need to add more environments into Octopus Deploy specially production so from testing server I can promote a build on live server without ftp and have support for rolling back.</li>
<li>Need to have more Powershell script to clean files of builds older than a month to save disk space.</li>
<li>Need to integrate twitter to post tweets about server status and post readings on slack. Monitoring bandwidth, hard disk space and some other events comes handy.</li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://blog.najamsikander.com/blog/2014/11/16/lcl-2014-islamabad/"/>
    <updated>2014-11-16T16:25:00+05:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.najamsikander.com/blog/2014/11/16/lcl-2014-islamabad</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>LCL 2014 third annual conference held on 15th November 2014 at Jinnah Convention center. It was full day event and was targeting students, entrepreneurs and industry on large scale. Due to marketing hype, organizers, speakers list most of they people set their expectations to high level including me.</p>

<p>I was interested in this event for couple of reasons for starters networking, interaction with students for <a href="http://codebar.pk">CodeBar</a> and last but not the least learning something new and useful. My fear was spending full day and achieving none of the goals I have set for this event at the cost of developing time required by <a href="http://codebar.pk">CodeBar</a>. Let me break down my day at this event and point out what went wrong, what worked and the result.</p>

<h2>Event Day</h2>

<p>Myself and Jumpstart Pakistan team gathered on our meeting place we pick equipment for our promised stall and start our journey to reach Convention Center.</p>

<h3>Greetings</h3>

<p>We wanted to reach on time to setup our promised stall but after spending time and moving up and down we decided not to put any stall. There were no power sources for our equipment, tables that were arranged after a long wait were not aligned and one fall with laptop over it. While we were figuring out what to do next, organizers were figuring out when to start. For unknown reasons event started late and this affected execution of the event.</p>

<h3>Internet</h3>

<p>There was no wifi available to participants our team&#8217;s wifi has been shared with limited participants including LCL social media team.</p>

<h3>Power sockets for charging</h3>

<p>In absence of power sources to charge equipment my laptop died. Few people were roaming around to find from where they can charge their devices. While organizers were telling everyone to use #LCL2014 on all social media (twitter, facebook, instagram).</p>

<h3>Speeches</h3>

<p>I must say large audience might like all this speech theme conference but to me it was not exciting. They were just for motivation not focusing on specifics. Interactions were down to zero due to time limitations. Few speeches were made to win the crowd but few which felt dry to many actually had some value. One such speech was disturbed greatly by arrival of Mr. Asad Umer. Now one more thing about speeches I have listen to many of them and now they feel redundant to me. I have heard some great and wise personalities like Mr. Asad Umer, Rozee Guru Mr. Monis but now instead of angro or rozee I want to know what other success they have. What small things they created that became big and created name of its own.</p>

<h3>Entrepreneurs</h3>

<p>LCL 2014 had some big names that gains lots of attention but it&#8217;s hard for beginners or students to connect with them to seek help or guidance. I personally feel there are many local entrepreneurs that are more reachable to me and many other people and they should be on stage in large events.</p>

<h3>Water</h3>

<p>I have been looking for water after lunch but couldn&#8217;t find it on my own. That was really a big downer.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>I have been in &#8220;Convention Center&#8221; and I think it&#8217;s really a bad place to arrange any event or conference for tech people.</p>

<p>For tech events Internet and power supply is a must have and you can&#8217;t have positive impact without them so always have dedicated connection for audience and digital content publishers.</p>

<p>It was an effort and I know it&#8217;s almost impossible to organize and execute a large event without making someone really unhappy. I am hoping LCL team keep doing good work and rectify the issue one by one for their future events.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When your web application is running on web server and you don&#8217;t have automatic backup service available form your hosting service provider taking manual backups is really a frustrating job.</p>

<p>I have <a href="https://pscx.codeplex.com/">Pscx</a> module installed on my PC and they have a nice little command Write-Zip available so I decided to write a custom powershell function that can create archive in zip formats for me. You can use windows task scheduler to invoke any powershell script so you can take advantage of this to have automatic daily or monthly backups.</p>

<p>I am learning powershell and trying to build lego blocks that will eventually become recipes for automating tasks on different servers. One important block is email report for that if you don&#8217;t have smtp configured on server you can use following powershell script with gmail SMTP information.</p>

<p>I will open source on <a href="https://github.com/najamsk/powershellRepo">github</a> many of the small powershell scripts that you can make use of to build something cool.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.najamsikander.com/blog/2014/01/25/open-letter-to-ptcl-desi-version/"/>
    <updated>2014-01-25T11:42:00+05:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.najamsikander.com/blog/2014/01/25/open-letter-to-ptcl-desi-version</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Following is the email I  have sent to ebill@ptcl.net.pk it&#8217;s unplugged raw version so don&#8217;t mind about mistakes.</p>

<p>Since i have shifted to new house date you can check in your records that corresponds with address change I am facing dsl connection issues with line disturbance</p>

<p>I have tried all mediums to get some help for permanent solution but no luck that involves talking to agents, exchange staff, email to billing team and ptcl twitter account. Every time when situation reach to worst point where I could take no more they promise me some fix that can only work for 5 days at its best.</p>

<p>I have no of issues
 * charged for address change moths ago but not getting printed bill. Mention this to call center agent promised this will be fix but as you ptcl more then me you can guess the result.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Line is noisy and cause of data loss even when its no noise or less simple ping command can show you that. But the staff &#8220;Technical&#8221; staff mostly visit me don&#8217;t know about ping they just open a website and say see website work tor this vary instant its working we cant do anything else. Lineman also king of UAE I guess even ptcl staff don&#8217;t have power to call him when they require him. I am not joking one of ptcl dsl department guy told me once &#8220;sir mai call kar kar kai thak gia hoon usi kai liyeah app kai ghar kai bhair khara hoon aub app khud he lineman kai liyeah ptcl mai kisi ko bolyeah mai kuch nahi kar sakta&#8221;</p></li>
<li><p>Dsl stablity: speed is slow most of the time. Now a days if phone rings net disconnect, if someone pick receiver net disconnect, if you are talking on phone net disconnect.</p></li>
<li><p>Call center: every time same questions, same promises but no result. Yestday 24 jan 201 I talked to your agent between 9:00pm to 10:00pm. it was long a call and i wanted him to terminate my services but he said 24 hours time required and I am personally involved with your complaint. Today in morning when I get up from bed I check sms from ptcl saying my complaint no  93 has been closed yesterday around 10:00pm.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Filled with anger called your call center female agent again asking me whats the issue like there is no complaint history in front of her i ask for manage but that manager is not for common people of pakistan so after her  promises that were not new she said talk to supervisor which I refused and asked her to transfer my call to billing department.</p>

<p>I do believe same person picked my call as billing representative and when i told her remove my dsl and phone line from billing she start doing same promises. When i explain the whole history to her then she said all the time I am facing issue with line or dsl that can be adjusted in billing. Imagine my surprise with my complaint history in which i have faced dead phone line for 15 days and  I was never told of this thing by any call center agent. So this is one new problem I discover called &#8220;Theft&#8221;. Anyways she said before this day ends my problem will be fixed she will be taking this matter with her seniors, army cheif and prime minister of pakistan and i will not face this kind of issue again.</p>

<p>So based on above if you read all i wrote above after wasting 30 more minutes of life with PTCL tag on it kindly remove me from billing (land-line and dsl) if my issue is not fixed by day end.</p>

<p>I will pay the latest bill i have already printed and after that would not pay anything in case you are still keeping me in your billing records.</p>

<p>Best,</p>

    <link href="http://blog.najamsikander.com/blog/2013/10/22/mongodb-setup-on-windows-8/"/>
    <updated>2013-10-22T13:15:00+05:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.najamsikander.com/blog/2013/10/22/mongodb-setup-on-windows-8</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am very much into learning new tools and burning hours of my life trying to figure them out. To track whats new on development horizon and technology I tend to keep my eyes on sessions, conferences, blogs and screen-casts.</p>

<p>In past few days I wanted to explore no-sql options two in particular RavenDB and MongoDB. I have successfully completed the environment setup for raven but didn&#8217;t use it in any project until now. On the other hand I have built a new website for my current employer using MVC4 and MongoDB. I have learned a a lot and in this blog post I will share few commands to setup mongoDB and deploy it on remote server.</p>

<p>You can download MongoDb zip file from http://www.mongodb.org/downloads. I picked 64bit version of it.</p>

<h2>Installing MongoDb as windows service</h2>

<p>To install MongoDB using your command prompt navigate to the bin folder in my case it was on following path:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>D:\mongodb\bin></span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then run following command to install it</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>D:\mongodb\bin>mongod --dbpath=D:\mongodb --logpath=D:\mongodb\log.txt --install</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then you can goto windows services and look for MongoDB service and simply start it. If you face any error during installation make sure you launch command prompt as administrator and log.txt file used in above command do exists in your hard drive.</p>

<p>If for some reason you want to un-install the MongoDB service run following command in command prompt after stopping service from system services.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>D:\mongodb\bin>mongod --remove</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>GUI to manage MongoDB</h2>

<p>You can interact with MongoDb database and collections using command prompt it will make you master of the little quires against small frequent tasks. In my case I wanted some simple GUI to perform simple tasks and I came across <a href="http://robomongo.org/">RoboMongo</a>.</p>

<p>Installation is simple once this tool is installed and you have your MongoDb service up and running. click on the create button showing in following screen.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-W5SYuoYBfqE/UmZNepJZPkI/AAAAAAAACcQ/LVaMJiW2k50/w668-h410-no/roboCreate.jpg" alt="Robo Mongo Connection Screen" /></p>

<p>Proceed with defaults in address I have localhost and using port 27017. After connection is created you can click on the connect button and it will show you following screen listing with your databases and collections.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/fJjuZWRgwzWSRNwF0HzVw4bJ8JryEKLuAwWWIaKlfEY=w1183-h737-no" alt="Robo Mongo Showing Databases and Collections" /></p>

<h2>Deployment</h2>

<p>After completing v1.0 I have been asked to deploy our new web site on remote server. Asp.net deployment was not a big deal but to deploy local MongoDb database onto remote I had to read about two commands <em>mongodump</em> and <em>mongorestore</em></p>

<p>First to create a backup file of my local mongoDB database I run following command</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>mongodump --db DBName</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Above command will generate called DBName under MongoDB_Installation_Folder/bin/dump inside generated folder you will find <em>.bson</em> files for all the collections your database contains. I have uploaded this folder on remote server.</p>

<p>Now to restore MongoDB on remote server I used mongorestore command syntax is simple you need to supply foldername/dbname to restore</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>mongorestore dump/DBName</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Once restore is completed successfully you can check your database on remote using RoboMongo.</p>

<p>I hope this will help someone starting with MongoDB thank you for reading my blog.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I needed to genrate an email log that contains every email from our clients these normally stored in their seprate folder. One way was to copy and paste email headers and body into a word document. Second was to use powershell and got all the emails using some script.</p>

<p>After playing a little with powershell and google few of its basic I have completed my task with powershell.</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/5944505.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>Above code is used to select a folder under your outlook inbox in my case its jun 2013 which comes under EmailLog which is under my inbox. I have saved the result of this function into a variable. That would be passed into second function for html creation.</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/5944515.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>This function will take email objects and wrap html mark around them before saving them into a html file.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The term TDD is not new to me I heard it quite often but never took time to go into details until last few days. I have been checking stuff from YUI team and liked their YUI test framework for now ,but in future i might switch to qUint (jquery testing framework) as I am big fan of jQuery and using it daily.</p>

<p>There are different version of YUI like 2.0,3.0 and standalone version of YUI test that has no dependency over YUI framework according to yui theater video.</p>

<p>So for learning purpose I have written few lines of jQuery to set color of a paragraph on mouse hover. I wrote a test using YUI; in the test I simulate mouse hover event and then checking the paragraph css color properties using jquery :).</p>

<p>Session was about windows 8 platform they have shown few apps that are developed in Pakistan and available for global audience. Highlight of the meetup was teams that have participated in Imagine cup and from pakistan. Team with first position showcased their project and I was blown away by their concept, presentation and business skills.</p>

<p>These students are from <a href="http://www.giki.edu.pk/">Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute</a> and their project is called &#8220;EPI-C&#8221; do check it out.</p>

    <id>http://blog.najamsikander.com/blog/2013/04/24/attended-bahria-university-job-fair</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Bahria university hosted a job fair session on 19th April 2013 in which they invites companies from local industry. My company also participated in the event.</p>

<p>Myself and few other from our company spend whole day in the event looking for suitable events in .net, mobile development and social media positions.</p>

<p>All day long I have been interviewing and the answers given by students in 6th and final semesters were disappointing.</p>

<p>Common reason for such answers were:</p>

<ul>
<li>teacher didn&#8217;t teach us good</li>
<li>course is not yet offered</li>
<li>what we have read we don&#8217;t remember at the moment</li>
<li>we are here for internship in 6 months you will teach us and than we will score good job in some other company. I don&#8217;t who told them we are here for schooling and companies will be teaching them for 6 months. Why universities are not teaching them?</li>
</ul>


<p>After attending this I have been thinking about giving sessions to students in web development for following reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Introduce them what industry expects form them as fresh devs.</li>
<li>Also motivate them to learn more and don&#8217;t rely on university.</li>
<li>Do small contributions in open source for learning.</li>
</ul>


<p>In next post I will outlines topics for basic training if you are interested to contribute in this cause let me know. If you want to attend such sessions than you can contact me.</p>

<p>These sessions will be free and you can contribute in exercise files, topics and provide your valuable feedback.</p>

    <id>http://blog.najamsikander.com/blog/2013/04/22/playing-with-octopress-blogging</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I first came to know about octopress from yayquery episode in which rebbeca murphy mentioned she has moved her blog form wordpress to octopress and she is very happy with that. At that time I didn&#8217;t paid any attention to this.</p>

<p>But today I suddenly started to play with it and I liked few things I learn along the way and that kept me going till I have imported all of my posts from wordpress to github pages.</p>

<p>I have read following pages form octopress documentation for configuration and blogging:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://octopress.org/docs/configuring/">configuring octopress</a></li>
<li><a href="http://octopress.org/docs/blogging/">blogging with octopress</a></li>
<li>To migrate your wordpress posts to markdown files i have used <a href="https://github.com/theaob/wpXml2Jekyll">wpxml2jekyll</a></li>
<li>To integrate twitter into your octopress blog sidebar read <a href="http://blog.jmac.org/blog/2013/03/30/putting-twitter-back-into-octopress/">put twitter back into sidebar</a>
To link your octopress setup with github you have to run following this will ask for your user/organization repository.</li>
</ul>


<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>rake setup_github_pages</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Next you need to do following two commands to generate site from octopress and upload it to github repo.</p>

<pre><code>rake generate
rake deploy
</code></pre>

<p>I will have few things in mind to discover about octopress</p>

<ul>
<li>q: how to customize the styles/layout?</li>
<li>q: how to make twitter work in sidebar?</li>
<li>q: how to make rake preview to work against current copy in master branch?</li>
<li>q: how to make it work against blog.najamsikander.com</li>
<li>q: how to get my comments against each post from discuss?</li>
</ul>


<p>I will keep updating this post while discovering work around. I guess i will be ditching wordpress soon after finding all the answers.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have been watching Mix11 videos about asp.net mvc3 and felt pretty excited to mingle with these latest bits but I didn&#8217;t wanted to limit myself to local environment I wanted to know what efforts are required if I am developing with latest stuff one limitation I had that my host always take ages to update server so I had support for .net3.5. I email them about this thing and in reply they told me either wait 6 months or pay $8. Since I was dying to test out EF code first I paid them and within one day my hosting is all updated and now I am running my incomplete demo online :).</p>

<p>Deployment was a little bit scarier as my hosting doesn&#8217;t come with any publishing/deployment server but if you have vs2010 sp1 then you are in safe hands all you have to do is to click on add deployable dependencies then build your solution and upload using your favorite ftp client.</p>

<p>This far I like MVC3.0 , Nuget and MVC Scaffolding but I am still learning how to scaffold many to many relations or at least leverage scaffolding and then tune it to have many to many relations.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have spent so much money to build a dream PC for gaming and my web development work I was happy thought it was my investment and will recover it in future while working on it. But this never happened I worked on it successfully installed macOSX on it and then ubuntu using Virtualbox to setup my Node.JS environment but very time I need it most something bad happen. Always the worse part is not booting up and I never had any guesses where is the problem possible guesses always include ram, power supply, graphic card, processor or the Holy Motherboard in my case its always either MB or ram.</p>

<p>Now again when I want to use my PC its not working. Some parts are in warranty and some are not lets see what happens next as I am convincing myself to lift this more then 10kg of weight to carry to computer market for diagnosis.</p>

<p>Thats pretty much it. Thank you for still reading my blog.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Previously I have told you about my ubuntu setup running via virtual box. I was happily working till ubuntu 11 launched and I decided to upgrade to version 11, after update vbox is not doing fullscreen worse part is compiz also not working. It seems may be driver for my ati hd 4890 not working properly.</p>


<p>Possible fixes that I can think includes:</p>


<p>$ freshly install ubuntu 11 using virtual box.<br>
$ install ubuntu 10.10 again</p>


<p>If anyone knows any better solution please post.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well for some experiments that involved git and curl I was coming across the windows problem I was trying to make my way using cygwin but after few stuck I always get stuck. Everyone&#8217;s recommended solution  was using linux OS so I have download virtual box created a virtual machine and then installed ubuntu iso 10.10 32 bit. Now as I am trying to get some softwares like chrome and vim I got few errors in package manager saying something like waiting for jockey to end. Google comes to rescue in terminal I run following commands:</p>

<pre>
ps -e | grep jockey
sudo kill process_id
</pre>


<p>Second big problem was I wanted full screen when using ubuntu solution that I found in some forum is following:</p>

<p>The nut of what you will be doing:</p>

<ol>
<li>Install Ubuntu on VB.</li>
<li>After install and restart, go to the &#8216;Devices&#8217; menu for VirtualBox.</li>
<li>Select &#8216;Install Guest Additions&#8217;.</li>
<li>Open Terminal in Ubuntu.</li>
</ol>


<p>Type:
cd /media/cdrom0 (this puts you to the cdrom directory where you just mounted guest additions)
Press enter then type:
dir (this shows you what&#8217;s inside this directory.)
Press enter then type:
sudo sh ./VBoxLinuxAdditions-x86.run (this is what you would type if you have an x86 machine, typical. If you have an AMD use that one, and so forth.)</p>

<ol>
<li>Wait for update to complete.</li>
<li>Once complete, shut down Ubuntu.</li>
<li>Restart VirtualBox</li>
<li>Boot up Ubuntu.</li>
<li>Once booted, press cmd+F for fullscreen or cmd+L for seamless.</li>
</ol>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I read this article <a href="http://bit.ly/16pqBm">http://bit.ly/16pqBm</a> and find out the power of overflow that is when you set it to a value it creates a new block formatting context in simple word that means non floated element’s content will not flow around the floated element instead will get narrower.</p>

<p>PS. Width should not be mentioned for non floated content so it can get narrower.</p>
