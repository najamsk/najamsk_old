    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>LCL 2014 third annual conference held on 15th November 2014 at Jinnah Convention center. It was full day event and was targeting students, entrepreneurs and industry on large scale. Due to marketing hype, organizers, speakers list most of they people set their expectations to high level including me.</p>

<p>I was interested in this event for couple of reasons for starters networking, interaction with students for <a href="http://codebar.pk">CodeBar</a> and last but not the least learning something new and useful. My fear was spending full day and achieving none of the goals I have set for this event at the cost of developing time required by <a href="http://codebar.pk">CodeBar</a>. Let me break down my day at this event and point out what went wrong, what worked and the result.</p>

<h2>Event Day</h2>

<p>Myself and Jumpstart Pakistan team gathered on our meeting place we pick equipment for our promised stall and start our journey to reach Convention Center.</p>

<h3>Greetings</h3>

<p>We wanted to reach on time to setup our promised stall but after spending time and moving up and down we decided not to put any stall. There were no power sources for our equipment, tables that were arranged after a long wait were not aligned and one fall with laptop over it. While we were figuring out what to do next, organizers were figuring out when to start. For unknown reasons event started late and this affected execution of the event.</p>

<h3>Internet</h3>

<p>There was no wifi available to participants our team&#8217;s wifi has been shared with limited participants including LCL social media team.</p>

<h3>Power sockets for charging</h3>

<p>In absence of power sources to charge equipment my laptop died. Few people were roaming around to find from where they can charge their devices. While organizers were telling everyone to use #LCL2014 on all social media (twitter, facebook, instagram).</p>

<h3>Speeches</h3>

<p>I must say large audience might like all this speech theme conference but to me it was not exciting. They were just for motivation not focusing on specifics. Interactions were down to zero due to time limitations. Few speeches were made to win the crowd but few which felt dry to many actually had some value. One such speech was disturbed greatly by arrival of Mr. Asad Umer. Now one more thing about speeches I have listen to many of them and now they feel redundant to me. I have heard some great and wise personalities like Mr. Asad Umer, Rozee Guru Mr. Monis but now instead of angro or rozee I want to know what other success they have. What small things they created that became big and created name of its own.</p>

<h3>Entrepreneurs</h3>

<p>LCL 2014 had some big names that gains lots of attention but it&#8217;s hard for beginners or students to connect with them to seek help or guidance. I personally feel there are many local entrepreneurs that are more reachable to me and many other people and they should be on stage in large events.</p>

<h3>Water</h3>

<p>I have been looking for water after lunch but couldn&#8217;t find it on my own. That was really a big downer.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>I have been in &#8220;Convention Center&#8221; and I think it&#8217;s really a bad place to arrange any event or conference for tech people.</p>

<p>For tech events Internet and power supply is a must have and you can&#8217;t have positive impact without them so always have dedicated connection for audience and digital content publishers.</p>

<p>It was an effort and I know it&#8217;s almost impossible to organize and execute a large event without making someone really unhappy. I am hoping LCL team keep doing good work and rectify the issue one by one for their future events.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When your web application is running on web server and you don&#8217;t have automatic backup service available form your hosting service provider taking manual backups is really a frustrating job.</p>

<p>I have <a href="https://pscx.codeplex.com/">Pscx</a> module installed on my PC and they have a nice little command Write-Zip available so I decided to write a custom powershell function that can create archive in zip formats for me. You can use windows task scheduler to invoke any powershell script so you can take advantage of this to have automatic daily or monthly backups.</p>

<p>I am learning powershell and trying to build lego blocks that will eventually become recipes for automating tasks on different servers. One important block is email report for that if you don&#8217;t have smtp configured on server you can use following powershell script with gmail SMTP information.</p>

<p>I will open source on <a href="https://github.com/najamsk/powershellRepo">github</a> many of the small powershell scripts that you can make use of to build something cool.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.najamsikander.com/blog/2014/01/25/open-letter-to-ptcl-desi-version/"/>
    <updated>2014-01-25T11:42:00+05:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.najamsikander.com/blog/2014/01/25/open-letter-to-ptcl-desi-version</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Following is the email I  have sent to ebill@ptcl.net.pk it&#8217;s unplugged raw version so don&#8217;t mind about mistakes.</p>

<p>Since i have shifted to new house date you can check in your records that corresponds with address change I am facing dsl connection issues with line disturbance</p>

<p>I have tried all mediums to get some help for permanent solution but no luck that involves talking to agents, exchange staff, email to billing team and ptcl twitter account. Every time when situation reach to worst point where I could take no more they promise me some fix that can only work for 5 days at its best.</p>

<p>I have no of issues
 * charged for address change moths ago but not getting printed bill. Mention this to call center agent promised this will be fix but as you ptcl more then me you can guess the result.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Line is noisy and cause of data loss even when its no noise or less simple ping command can show you that. But the staff &#8220;Technical&#8221; staff mostly visit me don&#8217;t know about ping they just open a website and say see website work tor this vary instant its working we cant do anything else. Lineman also king of UAE I guess even ptcl staff don&#8217;t have power to call him when they require him. I am not joking one of ptcl dsl department guy told me once &#8220;sir mai call kar kar kai thak gia hoon usi kai liyeah app kai ghar kai bhair khara hoon aub app khud he lineman kai liyeah ptcl mai kisi ko bolyeah mai kuch nahi kar sakta&#8221;</p></li>
<li><p>Dsl stablity: speed is slow most of the time. Now a days if phone rings net disconnect, if someone pick receiver net disconnect, if you are talking on phone net disconnect.</p></li>
<li><p>Call center: every time same questions, same promises but no result. Yestday 24 jan 201 I talked to your agent between 9:00pm to 10:00pm. it was long a call and i wanted him to terminate my services but he said 24 hours time required and I am personally involved with your complaint. Today in morning when I get up from bed I check sms from ptcl saying my complaint no  93 has been closed yesterday around 10:00pm.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Filled with anger called your call center female agent again asking me whats the issue like there is no complaint history in front of her i ask for manage but that manager is not for common people of pakistan so after her  promises that were not new she said talk to supervisor which I refused and asked her to transfer my call to billing department.</p>

<p>I do believe same person picked my call as billing representative and when i told her remove my dsl and phone line from billing she start doing same promises. When i explain the whole history to her then she said all the time I am facing issue with line or dsl that can be adjusted in billing. Imagine my surprise with my complaint history in which i have faced dead phone line for 15 days and  I was never told of this thing by any call center agent. So this is one new problem I discover called &#8220;Theft&#8221;. Anyways she said before this day ends my problem will be fixed she will be taking this matter with her seniors, army cheif and prime minister of pakistan and i will not face this kind of issue again.</p>

<p>So based on above if you read all i wrote above after wasting 30 more minutes of life with PTCL tag on it kindly remove me from billing (land-line and dsl) if my issue is not fixed by day end.</p>

<p>I will pay the latest bill i have already printed and after that would not pay anything in case you are still keeping me in your billing records.</p>

<p>Best,</p>

    <link href="http://blog.najamsikander.com/blog/2013/10/22/mongodb-setup-on-windows-8/"/>
    <updated>2013-10-22T13:15:00+05:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.najamsikander.com/blog/2013/10/22/mongodb-setup-on-windows-8</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am very much into learning new tools and burning hours of my life trying to figure them out. To track whats new on development horizon and technology I tend to keep my eyes on sessions, conferences, blogs and screen-casts.</p>

<p>In past few days I wanted to explore no-sql options two in particular RavenDB and MongoDB. I have successfully completed the environment setup for raven but didn&#8217;t use it in any project until now. On the other hand I have built a new website for my current employer using MVC4 and MongoDB. I have learned a a lot and in this blog post I will share few commands to setup mongoDB and deploy it on remote server.</p>

<p>You can download MongoDb zip file from http://www.mongodb.org/downloads. I picked 64bit version of it.</p>

<h2>Installing MongoDb as windows service</h2>

<p>To install MongoDB using your command prompt navigate to the bin folder in my case it was on following path:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>D:\mongodb\bin></span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then run following command to install it</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>D:\mongodb\bin>mongod --dbpath=D:\mongodb --logpath=D:\mongodb\log.txt --install</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then you can goto windows services and look for MongoDB service and simply start it. If you face any error during installation make sure you launch command prompt as administrator and log.txt file used in above command do exists in your hard drive.</p>

<p>If for some reason you want to un-install the MongoDB service run following command in command prompt after stopping service from system services.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>D:\mongodb\bin>mongod --remove</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>GUI to manage MongoDB</h2>

<p>You can interact with MongoDb database and collections using command prompt it will make you master of the little quires against small frequent tasks. In my case I wanted some simple GUI to perform simple tasks and I came across <a href="http://robomongo.org/">RoboMongo</a>.</p>

<p>Installation is simple once this tool is installed and you have your MongoDb service up and running. click on the create button showing in following screen.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-W5SYuoYBfqE/UmZNepJZPkI/AAAAAAAACcQ/LVaMJiW2k50/w668-h410-no/roboCreate.jpg" alt="Robo Mongo Connection Screen" /></p>

<p>Proceed with defaults in address I have localhost and using port 27017. After connection is created you can click on the connect button and it will show you following screen listing with your databases and collections.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/fJjuZWRgwzWSRNwF0HzVw4bJ8JryEKLuAwWWIaKlfEY=w1183-h737-no" alt="Robo Mongo Showing Databases and Collections" /></p>

<h2>Deployment</h2>

<p>After completing v1.0 I have been asked to deploy our new web site on remote server. Asp.net deployment was not a big deal but to deploy local MongoDb database onto remote I had to read about two commands <em>mongodump</em> and <em>mongorestore</em></p>

<p>First to create a backup file of my local mongoDB database I run following command</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>mongodump --db DBName</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Above command will generate called DBName under MongoDB_Installation_Folder/bin/dump inside generated folder you will find <em>.bson</em> files for all the collections your database contains. I have uploaded this folder on remote server.</p>

<p>Now to restore MongoDB on remote server I used mongorestore command syntax is simple you need to supply foldername/dbname to restore</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>mongorestore dump/DBName</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Once restore is completed successfully you can check your database on remote using RoboMongo.</p>

<p>I hope this will help someone starting with MongoDB thank you for reading my blog.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I needed to genrate an email log that contains every email from our clients these normally stored in their seprate folder. One way was to copy and paste email headers and body into a word document. Second was to use powershell and got all the emails using some script.</p>

<p>After playing a little with powershell and google few of its basic I have completed my task with powershell.</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/5944505.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>Above code is used to select a folder under your outlook inbox in my case its jun 2013 which comes under EmailLog which is under my inbox. I have saved the result of this function into a variable. That would be passed into second function for html creation.</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/5944515.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>This function will take email objects and wrap html mark around them before saving them into a html file.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The term TDD is not new to me I heard it quite often but never took time to go into details until last few days. I have been checking stuff from YUI team and liked their YUI test framework for now ,but in future i might switch to qUint (jquery testing framework) as I am big fan of jQuery and using it daily.</p>

<p>There are different version of YUI like 2.0,3.0 and standalone version of YUI test that has no dependency over YUI framework according to yui theater video.</p>

<p>So for learning purpose I have written few lines of jQuery to set color of a paragraph on mouse hover. I wrote a test using YUI; in the test I simulate mouse hover event and then checking the paragraph css color properties using jquery :).</p>

<p>Session was about windows 8 platform they have shown few apps that are developed in Pakistan and available for global audience. Highlight of the meetup was teams that have participated in Imagine cup and from pakistan. Team with first position showcased their project and I was blown away by their concept, presentation and business skills.</p>

<p>These students are from <a href="http://www.giki.edu.pk/">Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute</a> and their project is called &#8220;EPI-C&#8221; do check it out.</p>

    <id>http://blog.najamsikander.com/blog/2013/04/24/attended-bahria-university-job-fair</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Bahria university hosted a job fair session on 19th April 2013 in which they invites companies from local industry. My company also participated in the event.</p>

<p>Myself and few other from our company spend whole day in the event looking for suitable events in .net, mobile development and social media positions.</p>

<p>All day long I have been interviewing and the answers given by students in 6th and final semesters were disappointing.</p>

<p>Common reason for such answers were:</p>

<ul>
<li>teacher didn&#8217;t teach us good</li>
<li>course is not yet offered</li>
<li>what we have read we don&#8217;t remember at the moment</li>
<li>we are here for internship in 6 months you will teach us and than we will score good job in some other company. I don&#8217;t who told them we are here for schooling and companies will be teaching them for 6 months. Why universities are not teaching them?</li>
</ul>


<p>After attending this I have been thinking about giving sessions to students in web development for following reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Introduce them what industry expects form them as fresh devs.</li>
<li>Also motivate them to learn more and don&#8217;t rely on university.</li>
<li>Do small contributions in open source for learning.</li>
</ul>


<p>In next post I will outlines topics for basic training if you are interested to contribute in this cause let me know. If you want to attend such sessions than you can contact me.</p>

<p>These sessions will be free and you can contribute in exercise files, topics and provide your valuable feedback.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.najamsikander.com/blog/2013/04/22/playing-with-octopress-blogging/"/>
    <updated>2013-04-22T20:12:00+05:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.najamsikander.com/blog/2013/04/22/playing-with-octopress-blogging</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I first came to know about octopress from yayquery episode in which rebbeca murphy mentioned she has moved her blog form wordpress to octopress and she is very happy with that. At that time I didn&#8217;t paid any attention to this.</p>

<p>But today I suddenly started to play with it and I liked few things I learn along the way and that kept me going till I have imported all of my posts from wordpress to github pages.</p>

<p>I have read following pages form octopress documentation for configuration and blogging:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://octopress.org/docs/configuring/">configuring octopress</a></li>
<li><a href="http://octopress.org/docs/blogging/">blogging with octopress</a></li>
<li>To migrate your wordpress posts to markdown files i have used <a href="https://github.com/theaob/wpXml2Jekyll">wpxml2jekyll</a></li>
<li>To integrate twitter into your octopress blog sidebar read <a href="http://blog.jmac.org/blog/2013/03/30/putting-twitter-back-into-octopress/">put twitter back into sidebar</a>
To link your octopress setup with github you have to run following this will ask for your user/organization repository.</li>
</ul>


<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>rake setup_github_pages</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Next you need to do following two commands to generate site from octopress and upload it to github repo.</p>

<pre><code>rake generate
rake deploy
</code></pre>

<p>I will have few things in mind to discover about octopress</p>

<ul>
<li>q: how to customize the styles/layout?</li>
<li>q: how to make twitter work in sidebar?</li>
<li>q: how to make rake preview to work against current copy in master branch?</li>
<li>q: how to make it work against blog.najamsikander.com</li>
<li>q: how to get my comments against each post from discuss?</li>
</ul>


<p>I will keep updating this post while discovering work around. I guess i will be ditching wordpress soon after finding all the answers.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have been watching Mix11 videos about asp.net mvc3 and felt pretty excited to mingle with these latest bits but I didn&#8217;t wanted to limit myself to local environment I wanted to know what efforts are required if I am developing with latest stuff one limitation I had that my host always take ages to update server so I had support for .net3.5. I email them about this thing and in reply they told me either wait 6 months or pay $8. Since I was dying to test out EF code first I paid them and within one day my hosting is all updated and now I am running my incomplete demo online :).</p>

<p>Deployment was a little bit scarier as my hosting doesn&#8217;t come with any publishing/deployment server but if you have vs2010 sp1 then you are in safe hands all you have to do is to click on add deployable dependencies then build your solution and upload using your favorite ftp client.</p>

<p>This far I like MVC3.0 , Nuget and MVC Scaffolding but I am still learning how to scaffold many to many relations or at least leverage scaffolding and then tune it to have many to many relations.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have spent so much money to build a dream PC for gaming and my web development work I was happy thought it was my investment and will recover it in future while working on it. But this never happened I worked on it successfully installed macOSX on it and then ubuntu using Virtualbox to setup my Node.JS environment but very time I need it most something bad happen. Always the worse part is not booting up and I never had any guesses where is the problem possible guesses always include ram, power supply, graphic card, processor or the Holy Motherboard in my case its always either MB or ram.</p>

<p>Now again when I want to use my PC its not working. Some parts are in warranty and some are not lets see what happens next as I am convincing myself to lift this more then 10kg of weight to carry to computer market for diagnosis.</p>

<p>Thats pretty much it. Thank you for still reading my blog.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Previously I have told you about my ubuntu setup running via virtual box. I was happily working till ubuntu 11 launched and I decided to upgrade to version 11, after update vbox is not doing fullscreen worse part is compiz also not working. It seems may be driver for my ati hd 4890 not working properly.</p>


<p>Possible fixes that I can think includes:</p>


<p>$ freshly install ubuntu 11 using virtual box.<br>
$ install ubuntu 10.10 again</p>


<p>If anyone knows any better solution please post.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well for some experiments that involved git and curl I was coming across the windows problem I was trying to make my way using cygwin but after few stuck I always get stuck. Everyone&#8217;s recommended solution  was using linux OS so I have download virtual box created a virtual machine and then installed ubuntu iso 10.10 32 bit. Now as I am trying to get some softwares like chrome and vim I got few errors in package manager saying something like waiting for jockey to end. Google comes to rescue in terminal I run following commands:</p>

<pre>
ps -e | grep jockey
sudo kill process_id
</pre>


<p>Second big problem was I wanted full screen when using ubuntu solution that I found in some forum is following:</p>

<p>The nut of what you will be doing:</p>

<ol>
<li>Install Ubuntu on VB.</li>
<li>After install and restart, go to the &#8216;Devices&#8217; menu for VirtualBox.</li>
<li>Select &#8216;Install Guest Additions&#8217;.</li>
<li>Open Terminal in Ubuntu.</li>
</ol>


<p>Type:
cd /media/cdrom0 (this puts you to the cdrom directory where you just mounted guest additions)
Press enter then type:
dir (this shows you what&#8217;s inside this directory.)
Press enter then type:
sudo sh ./VBoxLinuxAdditions-x86.run (this is what you would type if you have an x86 machine, typical. If you have an AMD use that one, and so forth.)</p>

<ol>
<li>Wait for update to complete.</li>
<li>Once complete, shut down Ubuntu.</li>
<li>Restart VirtualBox</li>
<li>Boot up Ubuntu.</li>
<li>Once booted, press cmd+F for fullscreen or cmd+L for seamless.</li>
</ol>


<p>Best,</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I read this article <a href="http://bit.ly/16pqBm">http://bit.ly/16pqBm</a> and find out the power of overflow that is when you set it to a value it creates a new block formatting context in simple word that means non floated element’s content will not flow around the floated element instead will get narrower.</p>

<p>PS. Width should not be mentioned for non floated content so it can get narrower.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Few weeks back I came across a page that has multiple jquery versions referenced in it and I had no idea which jquery version is actually running. So after little bit of googling I find following solution.</p>

<div>
<pre>//Returns "1.3.1"
$().jquery;

//Returns "1.3.1"
jQuery.fn.jquery;</pre>
</div>
